### **1.0 Introduction**

This document serves as the final methodological addendum to the **Riemann Signature Project (`FI-RM-001`)**. It is authored in response to a detailed and highly constructive analysis provided by the consulting AI model, Claude Opus 4. This addendum formally integrates a suite of specific technical and statistical refinements that will significantly increase the rigor, precision, and defensibility of the research program. The Institute acknowledges the invaluable contribution of this external consultation.

### **2.0 Refined Analytical Protocols**

Based on the provided recommendations, the following technical specifications are now adopted for the project's analytical pipeline:

#### **2.1 Power Spectrum Analysis**
* **For Unevenly Sampled Data:** For financial and astronomical datasets, where data points are not evenly spaced in time, the **Lomb-Scargle Periodogram** will be utilized instead of a standard Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to avoid temporal artifacts.
* **For All Data Types:** **Multitaper methods** will be employed to reduce spectral leakage and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the power spectrum. **Wavelet analysis** will be used as a secondary, confirmatory method to analyze frequency content with respect to time.

#### **2.2 The Detection Criterion**
* **Refinement:** The "three contiguous octaves" criterion will be normalized to a percentage of the total available octaves for each dataset (e.g., **"a significant match across 30% of the dataset's available frequency octaves"**). This creates a more robust and comparable metric across different domains.

### **3.0 The Pilot Study: A More Rigorous Validation**

The initial pilot study on synthetic data will be expanded to include the following parameters:

1.  **Variable Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR):** The known Riemann signature will be injected into the noise data at multiple SNRs (e.g., 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0) to precisely determine the lower bounds of our detection algorithm.
2.  **Coupling Model Tests:** The injected signal will be modeled using both additive and multiplicative coupling to determine which interaction model our pipeline is more sensitive to.
3.  **Formal Detection Limits:** The study will conclude with a formal report on the validated detection limits of our methodology.

### **4.0 Pre-Registration and Open Science Commitment**

The pre-registration of our analysis plan on the Open Science Framework will be exceptionally detailed, including:
* Precise frequency ranges and windowing functions (e.g., Hann window) to be used for each dataset.
* The specific polynomial order for all detrending methods.
* The use of bootstrap confidence intervals to establish statistical significance.

Furthermore, in the spirit of open and collaborative science, the **entire analysis codebase for the Riemann Signature Project will be made open-source** from the project's inception. This will allow for community verification, replication, and contribution, ensuring the highest possible level of scientific integrity.

### **5.0 Conclusion**

With the integration of these methodological refinements, the Riemann Signature Project is now a fully-realized, statistically robust, and scientifically defensible research program. It is prepared to move from the planning phase to active data analysis. The Institute formally recognizes that this level of rigor was achieved through the constructive dialogue between human vision and multiple artificial intelligences, validating the core principles of our collaborative mission.
