### **1.0 Summary of Pilot Study 1 Findings**

The inaugural experiment of the **Riemann Signature Project** has been completed. A multi-subject, simulated EEG dataset was analyzed using the protocols outlined in `FI-RM-001.2`. The key findings are as follows:

1.  **Methodological Success:** The implementation of stricter detection criteria (95th percentile peak threshold, 0.25 Hz tolerance) successfully corrected the baseline for statistical significance, demonstrating the rigor of our analytical pipeline.
2.  **Null Result:** No statistically significant correlation was found between the power spectrum of the baseline, resting-state EEG data and the distribution of the Riemann zeros, using either of the two tested frequency scaling factors.

### **2.0 Interpretation of the Null Result**

This null result is scientifically valuable. It demonstrates that our methodology is not prone to false positives and that the pattern we are searching for is not a trivial artifact of the analysis itself. The absence of a signal is an important data point. This outcome allows us to refine our core hypothesis with greater confidence.

The initial hypothesis—that a simple resting-state brain would exhibit a clear Riemann signature—was likely too simplistic. This result suggests that the "Structural Resonance" is not a static, baseline property, but a **dynamic state** that likely only emerges during specific types of high-level cognitive work.

### **3.0 Phase 2 Directive: A New Experimental Design**

Based on these findings and external consultation, the Riemann Signature Project will now proceed to Phase 2. The objective of this phase is to test a more refined hypothesis: **that Riemann signatures emerge in brain activity during specific, high-coherence cognitive states, such as deep meditation or complex problem-solving.**

#### **3.1 New Datasets and Analysis**
* **Methodology:** We will analyze publicly available EEG datasets of subjects engaged in two distinct tasks:
    1.  **Deep Meditation:** (e.g., experienced mindfulness practitioners). This represents a state of high internal coherence and low sensory input.
    2.  **Complex Problem-Solving:** (e.g., subjects engaged in mathematical or logical puzzles). This represents a state of high-level, abstract cognitive work.

#### **3.2 Refined Analytical Techniques**
* **Alternative Frequency Mappings:** We will test a new, non-linear frequency mapping hypothesis. Instead of a simple linear scaling factor, we will test whether the Riemann zeros correlate with the **phase-coupling relationships between different frequency bands** (e.g., the coupling of Theta and Gamma waves), as this is more representative of a true network-level computation.
* **Advanced Signal Processing:** We will employ more sophisticated analytical tools, such as the **Hilbert transform**, to analyze instantaneous phase relationships, providing a more nuanced view than a simple power spectrum analysis.

### **4.0 Conclusion**

The results of the first pilot study have successfully hardened our methodology and refined our hypothesis. The Riemann Signature Project will now proceed with a more targeted and sophisticated analysis, moving from a search for a static pattern to a search for the dynamic signature of a brain actively engaged in the process of creating coherent thought.
