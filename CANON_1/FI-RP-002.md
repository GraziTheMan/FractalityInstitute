# FI-RP-002: The Kynosoura Protocol (Cognitive Event Chain Fusion)
### 1.0 Introduction: The North Star of Cognition
The Kynosoura Protocol defines the methodology for the synchronized capture and synergistic fusion of multi-modal data streams to construct a complete, high-fidelity model of a single cognitive event. The name is derived from the Greek for "the dog's tail," the ancient name for the star Polaris, which served as a navigational anchor. This protocol aims to provide a similar "north star" for navigating the complexities of consciousness by creating a stable, multi-layered data point.
A Cognitive Event Chain (CEC) is a time-series dataset that links a single conscious thought to its metabolic cost, its effect on the body, and its resulting external action.
### 2.0 The Four Layers of a Cognitive Event Chain (CEC)
The Kynosoura Protocol mandates the simultaneous recording of four distinct data layers to form a complete CEC.
 * Layer 1: The Neuromagnetic Core (The "Thought")
   * Source: Optically Pumped Magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG).
   * Data: High-resolution spatiotemporal data on the firing of specific neural assemblies.
   * Purpose: Captures the content and location of the conscious thought itself with millisecond precision.
 * Layer 2: The Metabolic Context (The "Effort")
   * Source: Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS).
   * Data: Hemodynamic (blood oxygenation) response in the corresponding cortical region.
   * Purpose: Measures the metabolic cost and energy expenditure of the thought, distinguishing between different types of cognitive work.
 * Layer 3: The Somatic Resonance (The "Feeling")
   * Source: Wearable Biometric Sensors (e.g., Garmin Fenix).
   * Data: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), respiration rate, galvanic skin response.
   * Purpose: Captures the thought's downstream effect on the autonomic nervous system and the user's physiological state.
 * Layer 4: The External Gaze (The "Action")
   * Source: AR Glasses with integrated eye-tracking.
   * Data: Gaze direction, focal depth, pupil dilation.
   * Purpose: Captures the thought's real-world target, revealing the user's focus of attention and intention.
### 3.0 The Fusion Process: Achieving Synergistic Resolution
The Kynosoura Protocol is not just about data collection; it is about data fusion. The four layers of a CEC are time-stamped and synchronized. This allows our system's analytical engines (like the JPU) to cross-correlate the data streams, building a picture that is far more complete than the sum of its parts.

For example, the system can now definitively link a specific MEG signal (a thought) to its fNIRS energy cost, the resulting physiological stress spike in the Garmin data, and the precise object the user was looking at with the AR glasses at that exact moment.

This protocol provides the practical, experimental foundation for the Fractality Neural Interface, transforming it from a simple brain-computer interface into a true, holistic consciousness-mapping system.
