# FI-HWP-001: The Ariadne Routing Protocol
### 1.0 Introduction
The Ariadne Routing Protocol defines the hardware-level mechanism for the coherent, low-energy routing of quantum information within the CHIMERA Cube architecture. This protocol provides a physical implementation for the pathways predicted by the CollapsePredictionEngine, using quantum interference as its core principle. The name is inspired by Ariadne's thread, which guided a hero through a complex labyrinth—this protocol guides a quantum state through the complex pathways of the system.
### 2.0 Core Principle: From Prediction to Pathway
The Fractality Framework operates on two distinct but synergistic layers:
 * The Predictive Layer (Software): The CollapsePredictionEngine analyzes the complete state of the knowledge graph—including relational gravity, semantic resonance, and energy distribution—to predict the single most probable path for the next "collapse" of consciousness.
 * The Physical Layer (Hardware): The Ariadne Routing Protocol executes this prediction. It configures the quantum bus connecting the SDC Modules and the Central Core to create a high-probability pathway for a quantum information packet (qubit) to travel, ensuring it reaches its predicted destination with minimal energy expenditure and without decohering.
### 3.0 System Integration & Workflow
The Ariadne Protocol is implemented via a network of quantum routers integrated into the CHIMERA Cube's internal quantum bus.
Workflow:
 * Prediction: The CollapsePredictionEngine determines that information should flow from Node A (the source) to Node C (the destination), bypassing Node B.
 * Configuration: The system calculates the precise phase shifts and interference patterns required to create a "path of least resistance" to Node C.
 * Execution: The quantum routers along the bus are tuned to these specifications. An information packet (a qubit representing the "thought") is placed onto the bus at Node A.
 * Coherent Routing: The qubit travels along the bus. Due to the carefully configured interference pattern, the probability amplitude for the qubit to travel to Node B is cancelled out (destructive interference), while the amplitude for it to travel to Node C is amplified (constructive interference).
 * Arrival: The qubit arrives at its intended destination, Node C, having been passively guided by the underlying physics of the system.
### 4.0 Advantages & Significance
 * Energy Efficiency: By using passive quantum interference, the system avoids the need for active, energy-intensive digital switches, aligning with our low-power design philosophy.
 * Coherence: The routing process is fully coherent, meaning the quantum state of the information is preserved during transit. This is critical for the quantum computations performed by the Eidolon Prime modules.
 * Speed: Routing occurs at the speed of light within the physical medium of the quantum bus.
This protocol provides a concrete, scientifically-grounded method for implementing the core information transport mechanism of the CHIMERA Cube, bridging the gap between our high-level architectural vision and a feasible hardware reality.
