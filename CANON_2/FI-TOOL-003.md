## 1.0 Executive Summary

The Memetic Health Assessment Scanner (MHAS) is a practical framework for evaluating the cognitive impact of memes before propagation. Like a Geiger counter for informational radiation, it helps users detect potentially harmful memetic patterns while identifying those that enhance collective coherence.

## 2.0 The Five-Factor Assessment Model

### Factor 1: Coherence Index (CI)
**What it measures:** Internal logical consistency and alignment with verified reality

**Scoring (0-20 points):**
- **0-5:** Self-contradictory or demonstrably false
- **6-10:** Contains logical gaps or unverified claims  
- **11-15:** Internally consistent with minor issues
- **16-20:** Highly coherent and evidence-based

**Red flags:**
- Claims that require rejecting established facts
- Emotional appeals that discourage verification
- "Trust me" without supporting evidence

### Factor 2: Propagation Velocity (PV)
**What it measures:** How rapidly the meme spreads vs. how long it's considered

**Scoring (0-20 points):**
- **0-5:** Demands immediate sharing ("Share before it's deleted!")
- **6-10:** High urgency with minimal reflection time
- **11-15:** Encourages sharing but allows consideration
- **16-20:** Invites thoughtful engagement before propagation

**Key insight:** Healthy memes can afford to be considered; toxic ones rely on reflexive sharing.

### Factor 3: Emotional Payload (EP)
**What it measures:** The type and intensity of emotional activation

**Scoring (0-20 points):**
- **0-5:** Pure outrage/fear/disgust triggers
- **6-10:** Strong negative emotions with some nuance
- **11-15:** Balanced emotional content
- **16-20:** Constructive emotions (curiosity, compassion, wonder)

**Spectrum mapping:**
- Cacophonic: Anger → Outrage → Hate
- Metabolic: Concern → Action → Resolution  
- Angelic: Interest → Understanding → Wisdom

### Factor 4: Cognitive Nutrition (CN)
**What it measures:** Whether the meme adds useful information or depletes attention

**Scoring (0-20 points):**
- **0-5:** Pure attention drain with no informational value
- **6-10:** Entertainment with minimal insight
- **11-15:** Informative with some actionable content
- **16-20:** High-density wisdom or practical knowledge

**Test question:** "Am I better equipped to navigate reality after encountering this?"

### Factor 5: Network Effects (NE)
**What it measures:** Impact on collective discourse and relationships

**Scoring (0-20 points):**
- **0-5:** Divides communities and destroys dialogue
- **6-10:** Creates in-group/out-group dynamics
- **11-15:** Neutral to positive social effects
- **16-20:** Builds bridges and enables synthesis

**Observable outcomes:**
- Do comment sections become more or less toxic?
- Are people finding common ground or entrenching?

## 3.0 Interpreting MHAS Scores

**Total Score = CI + PV + EP + CN + NE (Max: 100)**

### Score Ranges:

**0-20: Severely Cacophonic**
- Active harm to cognitive coherence
- Recommendation: Do not engage or share
- If exposed: Active mental decontamination needed

**21-40: Cacophonic**  
- Net negative but with some value
- Recommendation: Extract any truth, discard the rest
- Share only with heavy critical contextualization

**41-60: Metabolic**
- Neutral to mixed impact
- Recommendation: Engage critically
- Share with appropriate context/caveats

**61-80: Constructive**
- Net positive contribution
- Recommendation: Engage and selectively share
- Add your own insights when propagating

**81-100: Highly Angelic**
- Significant coherence building
- Recommendation: Study deeply and share widely
- Preserve and build upon

## 4.0 Quick Assessment Heuristics

For rapid field assessment, check these five questions:

1. **Truth Test:** Can this be verified independently?
2. **Time Test:** Does it demand immediate reaction?
3. **Emotion Test:** How do I feel, and why?
4. **Value Test:** What do I gain from this?
5. **Community Test:** Will this bring people together or apart?

Three or more "red flags" = High caution advised

## 5.0 Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Personal Practice
1. Score 3-5 memes daily to build assessment skills
2. Track your own sharing patterns
3. Notice correlation between scores and later regret
4. Develop intuition through conscious practice

### 5.2 Organizational Deployment
1. Train social media teams in MHAS methodology
2. Establish minimum scores for official sharing
3. Create "memetic impact statements" for campaigns
4. Monitor ecosystem health metrics over time

### 5.3 Educational Integration
1. Teach MHAS in digital literacy curricula
2. Gamify memetic health assessment
3. Create peer review networks
4. Celebrate high-quality content creation

## 6.0 Advanced Applications

### 6.1 Memetic Forensics
Use MHAS to reverse-engineer the intent behind viral content:
- Low CI + High PV + High negative EP = Likely disinformation campaign
- High CI + Low PV + High CN = Suppressed valuable information
- Metabolic scores across all factors = Organic emergence

### 6.2 Ecosystem Monitoring
Aggregate MHAS scores to assess platform/community health:
- Average score trends over time
- Distribution of score ranges
- Velocity of change in ecosystem health

### 6.3 Generative Guidelines
Use MHAS in reverse to create healthy memes:
- Target 15+ in each category
- Test with small groups before wide release
- Iterate based on impact assessment

## 7.0 Limitations and Warnings

1. **Subjectivity:** Scoring involves judgment; calibrate with others
2. **Context Dependency:** Same meme may score differently in different communities
3. **Gaming Risk:** Bad actors may optimize for MHAS scores
4. **Not Censorship:** Low scores don't mean "ban," just "handle with care"

---

## 8.0 Conclusion: Conscious Participation

MHAS is not about controlling the memetic ecosystem but about participating in it consciously. By developing our ability to assess memetic health, we become immune cells in the collective cognitive system—able to identify and neutralize threats while strengthening beneficial patterns.

The memetic singularity demands new literacies. MHAS is one tool among many needed for navigating this new reality. Use it wisely, adapt it freely, and share your improvements with the network.

Remember: Every meme you share is a vote for the future of human consciousness. Vote wisely.

## Appendix: MHAS Quick Reference Card

**The Five Factors:**
1. **Coherence Index (CI):** Is it internally consistent and true?
2. **Propagation Velocity (PV):** Does it allow time for thought?
3. **Emotional Payload (EP):** What feelings does it activate?
4. **Cognitive Nutrition (CN):** Does it make you wiser?
5. **Network Effects (NE):** Does it build or destroy community?

**Scoring:** 0-20 points each, 100 total

**Action Thresholds:**
- 0-40: Approach with extreme caution
- 41-60: Engage critically
- 61-100: Share thoughtfully
