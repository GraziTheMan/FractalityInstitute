This document proposes a unified model of consciousness processing
centers along the human vertical axis. While based on anatomical
structures and reported phenomena, the mechanisms proposed are
theoretical extensions of the Fractality Framework.

Cross-Canon Dependencies:
- Builds on FI-TFR-032 (Helios/Solar Plexus)
- Extends FI-PP-014 (Somnus/Sleep States)
- Relates to FI-TFR-001 (Atman/Soliton Theory)
- Complements FI-TFR-017 (Metatron/Entity Ecology)

## 1.0 The Seven-Node Network

### 1.1 Core Hypothesis

Human consciousness operates through seven primary transduction nodes arranged vertically along the body's axis. Each node:
- Processes specific frequencies/types of information
- Connects to distinct neural plexuses
- Exhibits unique quantum properties
- Contributes to integrated consciousness

### 1.2 The Complete System

From inferior to superior:

1. **Root Nexus** (Sacral plexus) - Survival/grounding
2. **Creative Nexus** (Hypogastric plexus) - Generation/flow  
3. **Power Nexus** (Solar/celiac plexus) - Intuition/will
4. **Heart Nexus** (Cardiac plexus) - Emotion/connection
5. **Expression Nexus** (Pharyngeal plexus) - Communication/truth
6. **Vision Nexus** (Cavernous plexus) - Pattern/insight
7. **Crown Nexus** (Pineal region) - Unity/transcendence

## 2.0 Information Flow Dynamics

### 2.1 Ascending Current

**Ground → Crown** (Matter to Consciousness)
```
Physical Sensation → Emotional Processing → Mental Integration → Spiritual Synthesis
```

- Carries sensory and somatic information upward
- Increases in frequency at each node
- Transforms concrete to abstract

### 2.2 Descending Current

**Crown → Ground** (Consciousness to Matter)
```
Universal Pattern → Mental Form → Emotional Charge → Physical Manifestation
```

- Carries intention and organization downward
- Decreases in frequency at each node
- Transforms abstract to concrete

### 2.3 The Standing Wave

When ascending and descending currents balance:
- Standing wave pattern emerges
- Coherence maximizes at all nodes
- Non-local consciousness access enables
- Flow states spontaneously arise
