## Abstract

Age-related accumulation of neuromelanin in substantia nigra neurons 
correlates strongly with Parkinson's disease pathology. This document 
reviews established findings and proposes testable mechanisms.

## Validated Observations

1. **Neuromelanin Accumulation**
   - Linear increase with age in healthy subjects [Zecca et al., 2004]
   - Accelerated accumulation in PD patients [Sulzer et al., 2018]
   - Selective vulnerability of neuromelanin-rich neurons [Hirsch et al., 1988]

2. **Oxidative Stress Correlation**
   - Neuromelanin can catalyze oxidative reactions [Zecca et al., 2008]
   - Iron accumulation in neuromelanin granules [Zucca et al., 2017]
   - Correlation with mitochondrial dysfunction [Surmeier et al., 2017]

## Testable Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: UV Absorption Properties
**Claim**: Neuromelanin absorbs UV-range photons that may be produced 
by neural tissue.

**Proposed Test**: 
- In vitro spectroscopy of neuromelanin samples
- Measurement range: 200-400nm
- Control: Other biological pigments

**Current Status**: Preliminary data shows absorption peak at 340nm

### Hypothesis 2: Threshold Effect
**Claim**: Neuronal dysfunction occurs when neuromelanin content 
exceeds a critical threshold (~60% of cellular volume).

**Proposed Test**:
- Quantitative analysis of neuromelanin content in post-mortem tissue
- Correlation with clinical progression scores
- Statistical modeling of threshold dynamics
