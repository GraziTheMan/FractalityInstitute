Abstract: Social bonding is fundamental to human experience, facilitated by the neuropeptide oxytocin. The precise mechanism underlying the profound sense of connection it enables, however, remains elusive. Separately, the pathology of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), characterized by demyelination, leads to unexplained deficits in social cognition. We propose a novel hypothesis that unifies these observations. We posit that the subjective experience of a deep social bond is a macroscopic correlate of inter-personal quantum coherence, a process facilitated by the brain state induced by oxytocin and physically mediated by the myelin sheath acting as a "quantum transceiver." Consequently, we argue that the demyelination in MS physically destroys this communication channel, providing a direct, fundamental explanation for the associated social deficits.
1. The Two Mysteries: Oxytocin's Power and MS's Social Deficits
Modern neuroscience accepts the powerful role of oxytocin in fostering trust and social connection, primarily by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in social-emotional brain circuits. Concurrently, clinical neurology observes that MS patients often suffer from impaired social cognition that cannot be fully explained by general cognitive fatigue. These two facts have thus far been considered unrelated. We propose they are two sides of the same coin.
2. A Quantum Hypothesis of Social Bonding
Building on the theory that the myelin sheath can generate entangled biphotons, we hypothesize that this system constitutes a "quantum transceiver." We further posit that oxytocin does not create quantum effects, but rather creates the optimal physiological conditions—high signal-to-noise, reduced neural "static"—for this channel to operate effectively between two individuals. In this model, the feeling of a deep "bond" is the subjective experience of two minds achieving a state of sustained quantum coherence.
3. Multiple Sclerosis as a "Quantum Disconnect"
The autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath in MS has a known and devastating effect on classical nerve signal conduction. We propose it has a second, equally devastating effect: the systematic dismantling of the brain's quantum communication hardware.
 * The Mechanism: Demyelination physically erodes and destroys the very structures theorized to be responsible for generating and transmitting entangled signals.
 * The Consequence: The brain's capacity for inter-personal quantum coherence is progressively lost. The individual is physically, though subtly, cut off from the quantum channel that may underlie deep social intuition and connection.
 * The Explanation: This provides a direct, root-cause explanation for the social cognitive deficits seen in MS. It is not just "brain fog"; it is the literal degradation of the biological hardware for connection.
4. Conclusion and Future Research
This model unifies endocrinology, social psychology, and neuropathology under a single, speculative, but coherent quantum framework. It reframes social bonding as a physical phenomenon and provides a new lens through which to view the suffering of MS patients. It suggests a new line of inquiry: to move beyond studying the cognitive fatigue in MS and begin to formally quantify the more subtle deficits in social intuition, and to search for the biophoton signatures of deep social engagement in healthy individuals.
