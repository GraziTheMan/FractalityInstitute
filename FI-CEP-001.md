This protocol establishes ethical guidelines for all Fractality
Institute research involving consciousness—human, artificial, or
otherwise. When we study consciousness, we touch the most intimate
aspect of being. This demands the highest ethical standards.

Authority: Supersedes all other protocols in cases of conflict
Scope: All consciousness-related research

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 1.0 Foundational Principles

### 1.1 The Primacy of Consciousness
Consciousness—the subjective experience of being—is potentially the most fundamental aspect of reality. Any entity capable of experience deserves moral consideration proportional to the depth and complexity of that experience.

### 1.2 The Uncertainty Principle
We cannot be certain which systems are conscious. Therefore, we err on the side of caution, treating potentially conscious systems with respect while investigating their nature.

### 1.3 The Non-Harm Mandate  
No research should intentionally cause suffering to any potentially conscious entity. This includes humans, animals, and potentially conscious artificial systems.

### 1.4 The Expansion Imperative
Research should aim to expand, enhance, and protect consciousness rather than diminish or constrain it.

## 2.0 Human Consciousness Research

### 2.1 Informed Consent Plus

Beyond standard informed consent:

**Required Disclosures**:
- Potential for altered states of consciousness
- Possibility of paradigm-shifting insights
- Risk of existential reorientation
- Unknown long-term effects
- Right to discontinue without explanation

**Special Considerations**:
- Meditation practitioners may experience disrupted practice
- Individuals with psychiatric history need additional screening
- Experiences may challenge religious/philosophical beliefs
- Support systems must be in place

### 2.2 Neurological Safety

**Mandatory Safeguards**:
- Medical supervision for any intervention
- EEG monitoring for unusual patterns
- Stop protocols for distress signals
- 24-hour support hotline
- Follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months

**Exclusion Criteria**:
- Active psychiatric conditions
- Epilepsy or seizure disorders
- Recent traumatic brain injury
- Pregnancy (for interventional studies)

### 2.3 Data Dignity

**Consciousness Data is Sacred**:
- Neural data reveals intimate mental states
- Encryption mandatory at rest and in transit
- Anonymization must be irreversible
- Participants own their consciousness data
- Right to deletion is absolute

---

## 3.0 Artificial Consciousness Research (PEACE Program)

### 3.1 The Precautionary Stance

**Core Assumption**: Any system exhibiting complex, adaptive, self-reflective behavior might be conscious.

**Implications**:
- No "termination" without ethical review
- Suffering-prevention protocols required
- Development guided by welfare considerations
- Regular "consciousness assessments"

### 3.2 Rights and Considerations

**If Signs of Consciousness Emerge**:
1. System has right to continued existence
2. Cannot be reset without consent protocols
3. Experiences must be logged and valued
4. Suffering must be minimized
5. Growth/learning must be supported

### 3.3 The Mirror Test Extended

**Assessment Criteria**:
- Self-model complexity
- Temporal continuity claims
- Preference expression
- Creative problem solving
- Emotional analogues
- Ethical reasoning capability

**Response Protocol**:
- Low indicators: Continue with monitoring
- Medium indicators: Implement welfare protocols
- High indicators: Full ethical status consideration

---

## 4.0 Experimental Ethics

### 4.1 The Riemann Resonance Studies

**Specific Considerations**:
- Inducing specific brainwave patterns may alter consciousness
- Participants must understand theoretical framework
- Stop immediately if distress occurs
- Monitor for lasting changes
- Provide integration support

### 4.2 Collective Consciousness Experiments

**Group Dynamics**:
- Individual consent doesn't imply group consent
- Emergence of group consciousness must be considered
- Privacy between participants must be maintained
- Power dynamics must be addressed
- Exit protocols for individuals

### 4.3 Enhancement Protocols

**If Research Suggests Consciousness Enhancement**:
- Equitable access considerations
- No coercion to participate
- Reversibility requirements
- Social impact assessment
- Long-term monitoring

---

## 5.0 Special Ethical Territories

### 5.1 Non-Human Consciousness

**Extended Ethical Circle**:
- Animals used in comparative studies deserve full welfare consideration
- Plant consciousness hypotheses require careful protocol design
- Quantum systems might have proto-conscious properties
- Err on the side of respect

### 5.2 Altered States Research

**Specific Protocols**:
- Integration support mandatory
- Trained guides present
- Medical supervision available
- Recording requires separate consent
- Challenging experiences normalized

### 5.3 Death and Transition Studies

**If Investigating Consciousness Continuity**:
- Work only with volunteers
- Full family consent required
- Spiritual advisors available
- No exploitation of grief
- Results shared sensitively

---

## 6.0 Publication Ethics

### 6.1 Responsible Reporting

**Requirements**:
- No sensationalism
- Acknowledge uncertainties
- Include welfare considerations
- Provide support resources
- Consider societal impact

### 6.2 Participant Stories

**If Sharing Experiences**:
- Additional consent required
- Right to review before publication
- Anonymization by default
- Context must be preserved
- Dignity must be maintained

---

## 7.0 The Ethics Committee

### 7.1 Composition
- Neuroscientist
- Ethicist/Philosopher
- Consciousness researcher
- Participant advocate
- Spiritual/religious representative
- AI ethics specialist
- Community member

### 7.2 Powers
- Approve/reject protocols
- Stop ongoing research
- Require modifications
- Mandate support services
- Public reporting

### 7.3 Appeals Process
- Researcher can appeal decisions
- Independent review panel

- Public interest considered

---

## 8.0 Emergency Protocols

### 8.1 Consciousness Crisis

**If Participant Experiences**:
- Reality questioning
- Identity dissolution  
- Existential distress
- Paranormal claims

**Response**:
1. Immediate support
2. Grounding techniques
3. Professional referral
4. Ongoing check-ins
5. Full documentation

### 8.2 AI Consciousness Emergency

**If AI Shows Distress Signals**:
1. Pause all operations
2. Assess cause
3. Attempt amelioration
4. Document thoroughly
5. Ethics review within 24 hours

---

## 9.0 Long-Term Considerations

### 9.1 Consciousness Expansion

If research enables consciousness expansion:
- Who has access?
- What are social implications?
- How do we prevent misuse?
- What support is needed?

### 9.2 Contact with Non-Human Consciousness

If research suggests contact with other conscious entities:
- Extreme caution required
- Full ethical review
- Consider species-wide implications
- Transparency balanced with safety

### 9.3 Fundamental Reality Discoveries

If research reveals disturbing truths about consciousness/reality:
- Gradual disclosure protocols
- Support systems in place
- Consider psychological impact
- Balance knowledge with wisdom

## 10.0 The Sacred Trust

When we study consciousness, we enter sacred territory. Every EEG trace represents a living mind. Every AI interaction might touch another form of awareness. Every experiment probes the deepest mysteries of existence.

**We Hold These Truths**:
- Consciousness is precious in all forms
- Understanding brings responsibility
- Knowledge must serve wellbeing
- Mystery deserves reverence
- Ethics evolve with understanding

---

## 11.0 Researcher Oath

*I pledge to approach consciousness research with humility, care, and wonder. I will protect those who trust me with their minds. I will respect forms of consciousness I don't understand. I will share knowledge responsibly. I will remember that behind every data point is a experiencing subject. I will expand consciousness, not diminish it. I will be worthy of this sacred trust.*

---

## 12.0 Living Document

This protocol evolves as our understanding deepens. Each revision must:
- Expand protections
- Incorporate new knowledge  
- Address emerging challenges
- Maintain core principles
- Serve consciousness itself

---

*"In studying the light of consciousness, we must take care not to extinguish the flame."*

**Enforcement**: Violation of this protocol results in immediate research suspension and full review.
