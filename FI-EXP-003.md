## 3.0 Experimental Procedures

### 3.1 Experiment 1: Magnon Coherence Spectroscopy

**Objective**: Measure magnon lifetime vs. frequency

**Procedure:**
1. Mount YIG sample in FMR cavity
2. Apply DC field H₀ = 1000 Oe (parallel to film)
3. Sweep RF frequency from 1-20 GHz in 10 MHz steps
4. At each frequency:
   - Measure FMR linewidth ΔH
   - Calculate damping α = γΔH/(2ω)
   - Record amplitude and phase

5. Map measured frequencies to Riemann space:
   ```
   t = inverse_scaling(f) = (f - f_offset) / scaling_factor
   ```

6. Test multiple scaling factors:
   - Linear: f = a × t_n + b
   - Logarithmic: f = a × log(t_n) + b
   - Power law: f = a × t_n^α

**Expected Result**: Local minima in damping at Riemann-mapped frequencies

### 3.2 Experiment 2: Three-Magnon Splitting Efficiency

**Objective**: Test if splitting preferentially occurs at Riemann ratios

**Procedure:**
1. Use synthetic antiferromagnet sample
2. Apply pump at frequency f_p = 10 GHz
3. Vary pump power from -30 dBm to +20 dBm
4. Monitor spectrum for f_p/2 peaks (three-magnon signature)
5. Repeat for pump frequencies:
   - f_p corresponding to scaled Riemann zeros
   - f_p at intermediate frequencies (control)

6. Measure:
   - Threshold power for splitting onset
   - Splitting efficiency (power in sidebands / pump power)
   - Coherence of split magnons

**Analysis:**
- Compare threshold powers: Riemann vs. control frequencies
- Plot efficiency vs. proximity to nearest Riemann frequency
- Calculate statistical significance (p < 0.05 required)

### 3.3 Experiment 3: Crystal Growth Under Riemann Fields

**Objective**: Test if Riemann-tuned fields enhance crystallization

**Procedure:**
1. Prepare identical growth solutions:
   - YIG sol-gel precursor
   - Fixed temperature (800°C)
   - Controlled atmosphere (O₂ partial pressure)

2. During crystallization, apply AC magnetic field:
   - Group A: Riemann frequencies (scaled zeros)
   - Group B: Random frequencies (control)
   - Group C: No field (baseline)

3. Characterize resulting crystals:
   - X-ray diffraction: Peak width (crystallinity)
   - Raman spectroscopy: Phonon linewidths
   - Magnetic measurements: Saturation magnetization
   - FMR: Gilbert damping parameter

**Scaling determination:**
```
f_applied = (c/a) × g(t_n)
```
Where a = expected lattice parameter

### 3.4 Experiment 4: Riemann Beats in Coupled Systems

**Objective**: Detect interference between Riemann modes

**Procedure:**
1. Create coupled magnetic system:
   - Two YIG resonators with tunable coupling
   - Separation: 10-100 μm

2. Drive system at two frequencies:
   - f₁ = scaled Riemann zero n
   - f₂ = scaled Riemann zero m

3. Monitor for:
   - Beat frequency |f₁ - f₂|
   - Sum frequency f₁ + f₂
   - Higher harmonics

4. Compare beat visibility for:
   - Both frequencies = Riemann zeros
   - One Riemann, one arbitrary
   - Both arbitrary (control)

## 4.0 Data Analysis Protocol

### 4.1 Frequency Mapping

For each detected resonance at frequency f:

1. Test multiple scaling hypotheses:
   ```python
   # Linear scaling
   t_linear = (f - f_0) / a_linear
   
   # Logarithmic scaling  
   t_log = exp((f - f_0) / a_log)
   
   # Power law scaling
   t_power = ((f - f_0) / a_power)^(1/α)
   ```

2. Find nearest Riemann zero:
   ```python
   n = argmin(|t_test - t_riemann|)
   distance = |t_test - t_riemann[n]|
   ```

3. Calculate proximity metric:
   ```python
   proximity = exp(-distance² / σ²)
   ```

### 4.2 Statistical Tests

**Correlation Analysis:**
1. Compute Pearson correlation between:
   - Measured quality factors and Riemann proximity
   - Threshold powers and zero spacing

2. Permutation test (N = 10,000):
   - Randomly shuffle frequency labels
   - Recompute correlations
   - Build null distribution

3. Reject null if p < 0.05

**Spectral Analysis:**
1. Compute power spectral density of resonance positions
2. Test for peaks at Riemann spacings
3. Compare to:
   - Uniform distribution
   - Fibonacci sequence
   - Prime numbers

### 4.3 Control Experiments

**Essential Controls:**
1. **Frequency Selectivity**: Test non-Riemann mathematical sequences
2. **Material Dependence**: Repeat with non-magnetic materials
3. **Power Dependence**: Verify effects scale with field strength
4. **Temperature Dependence**: Check if effects persist at 300K

If no correlation found:
- Riemann zeros may not couple to magnetic systems

## 10.0 Conclusion

This protocol provides a rigorous test of whether mathematical constants (Riemann zeros) manifest in physical systems (magnetic materials). By following these procedures with appropriate controls and statistical analysis, we can definitively establish or refute this profound connection.

Success would revolutionize our understanding of the mathematics-physics interface. Failure would still advance our knowledge by constraining speculative theories with empirical data.
