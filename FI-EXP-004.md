## 1.0 Objective

To experimentally verify the three-body scaling law across multiple orders of magnitude, from molecular to macroscopic systems, testing the prediction:

```
Λ_quantum = (ℏ/kT) × (f₃/f₂)² × N_modes^(1/3)
```

### 1.1 Primary Hypotheses

H1: Three-body quantum correlations exist at all scales with predictable scaling
H2: Dynamic stabilization enables room-temperature quantum coherence
H3: Cross-scale quantum information transfer is possible via three-body coupling

### 1.2 Null Hypothesis

H0: No scale-invariant pattern exists for three-body quantum systems

    C3 = np.mean(A * B * C)
    C3 -= np.mean(A) * np.mean(B * C)
    C3 -= np.mean(B) * np.mean(A * C)

def verify_scaling_law(sizes, correlations, temperatures):
    # Fit: Λ = (ℏ/kT) × (f₃/f₂)² × N^(1/3)
    lambda_quantum = correlations * temperatures / hbar
    N_modes = (sizes / lambda_thermal)**3
    
    # Log-log fit
    slope, intercept = np.polyfit(
        np.log(N_modes**(1/3)),
