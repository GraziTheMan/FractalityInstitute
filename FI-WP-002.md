# FI-WP-002: Eidolon Technical White Paper
1.0 Introduction
The Eidolon is a portable, low-power, neuromorphic co-processor designed for AI augmentation. It enables developers, researchers, and hobbyists to explore brain-inspired computing and accelerate adaptive pattern recognition tasks on a variety of host devices. Housed in a compact form factor and powered by a standard USB-C connection, the Eidolon serves as an accessible entry point into the future of computing.
2.0 Architecture
 * Processing Core: A 2x2 array of four (4) Neuromorphic Processing Units (NPUs). Each NPU is built upon an 8x8 memristor crossbar array, capable of performing massively parallel, low-power analog computation.
 * Controller: A central, low-power FPGA manages data flow between the four NPUs and the host device, allowing for reconfigurable, task-specific logic.
 * Interface: A single USB-C port provides both power and a high-speed data link to a host computer, smartphone, or other peripheral.
 * Enclosure: A shielded enclosure provides protection from electromagnetic interference (EMI) and includes an integrated thermal interface for heat dissipation.
3.0 Target Applications
The Eidolon is designed for a variety of edge AI and pattern recognition tasks:
 * Real-time Signal Analysis: Analyzing complex data streams from software-defined radios or other sensors.
 * Image Recognition: Performing quadrant-based parallel analysis of visual data.
 * Creative AI: Serving as a dedicated co-processor for generative art or music applications.
 * Educational Tool: Providing a hands-on platform for students and hobbyists to learn the principles of neuromorphic computing.
4.0 Open Source Ecosystem
The Eidolon is supported by the open-source Fractality Platform software, with all drivers, firmware, and control software released under a permissive license to encourage community development and innovation.
