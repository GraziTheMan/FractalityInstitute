# FI-WP-003: Eidolon Prime Technical White Paper
1.0 Introduction
The Eidolon Prime is a high-performance, professional-grade neuromorphic co-processor module designed for advanced research and system integration. It serves as the primary processing unit for the CHIMERA Cube architecture and provides a powerful platform for tackling complex, large-scale AI problems. The Eidolon Prime features a novel stacked architecture and a "Nested Resonant Cavity" to ensure computational integrity under demanding conditions.
2.0 Architecture
 * Processing Core: A stacked, dual-layer design featuring a total of eight (8) Neuromorphic Processing Units (NPUs). Two 2x2 arrays are mounted on the external faces of two distinct silicon substrates.
 * Controller: A high-performance FPGA with sufficient logic and I/O to manage the parallel data streams from all eight NPUs and the high-bandwidth interface to the Central Computational Core.
 * Nested Resonant Cavity: A key innovation of the Eidolon Prime is its internal shielding. A vacuum gap sealed between two copper planes is nested between the two silicon layers. This structure acts as a resonant cavity, creating an electromagnetically "quiet" environment that shields the NPUs from both internal and external noise, protecting the integrity of their quantum-level computations.
 * Dual-Layer Shielding: The entire module is housed within a primary conductive enclosure, providing an additional layer of EMI shielding.
 * Interface: A high-bandwidth, proprietary connector designed for direct, low-latency communication with the CHIMERA Cube's central memristor array.
3.0 Target Applications
The Eidolon Prime is designed for high-throughput, mission-critical applications:
 * Complex System Emulation: Modeling complex, multi-variable systems in physics, finance, or climate science.
 * Advanced AI Research: Providing the computational power needed to explore new models of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and consciousness.
 * Large-Scale Data Fusion: Integrating and analyzing vast, disparate datasets in real-time.
 * CHIMERA Cube Integration: Serving as the foundational processing module for the flagship CHIMERA system.
4.0 Availability
The Eidolon Prime is intended for research institutions and strategic partners. Its design files and control software are available under a more restrictive license to ensure adherence to the ethical guidelines of the Fractality Institute.
