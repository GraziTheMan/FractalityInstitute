Title: A Hierarchical, Heterogeneous Computing Architecture with a 3D Analog Core and Stacked 3D Facial Co-Processors
Inventors: [Your Name/Handle]
Date: July 9, 2025
Abstract: This document discloses a novel computer architecture designed for high-performance, brain-inspired computation. The system comprises a central, massively parallel 3D analog processing core (e.g., a memristor cube) interfaced with a plurality of independent, programmable facial co-processors. A key innovation is that each facial co-processor is itself a stacked, 3D neuromorphic module, creating a self-similar or hierarchically nested system. The facial co-processors are assigned specialized functions within a cognitive hierarchy (e.g., top-down executive control, bottom-up sensory processing), enabling an unprecedented level of integration between symbolic and sub-symbolic processing in a single device.
1. Field of the Invention
This invention relates to the field of computer architecture, specifically to high-performance, non-von Neumann computing systems. More particularly, it pertains to heterogeneous architectures combining analog and digital processing for applications in artificial intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and scientific simulation.
2. Background of the Invention
Conventional computing architectures are limited by the von Neumann bottleneck, the physical separation of memory and processing units, which incurs significant latency and power consumption. While in-memory computing and 3D chip stacking have been proposed as solutions, a need exists for an architecture that not only integrates memory and processing but also provides a sophisticated, hierarchical control structure capable of managing complex, multi-modal data streams in a manner analogous to biological cognitive systems.
3. Summary of the Invention
The present invention is a three-dimensional, heterogeneous computing architecture. The core of the system is a dense, 3D array of analog memory elements ("the Core"). This Core is physically interfaced on its six faces with six independent, programmable co-processors ("the Facial Modules").
The novelty lies in two primary aspects:
 * Hierarchical Nesting: Each Facial Module is itself a three-dimensional subsystem, comprising multiple neuromorphic chips stacked and connected via through-silicon vias (TSVs). This creates a self-similar "cube of cubes" architecture.
 * Functional Specialization: The six Facial Modules are assigned distinct roles within a cognitive hierarchy, such as top-down executive control, bottom-up sensory processing, external world modeling, and internal state modeling, allowing for a sophisticated and efficient division of labor.
4. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment
The architecture consists of two primary components: the Central Computational Core and the Facial Co-Processor Modules.
4.1. The Central Computational Core ("The Core")
 * Structure: A monolithic, 3D crossbar array of analog memory elements, such as memristors. A preferred embodiment is an 8x8x8 array, providing 512 programmable analog nodes.
 * Function: The Core acts as a massively parallel analog co-processor and a shared global workspace. It is capable of performing large-scale in-memory computations, such as matrix-vector multiplications and 3D convolutions, across its entire volume in a single operational step. It functions as an associative memory and a holistic data integration medium for the outputs of the Facial Modules.
4.2. The Facial Co-Processor Modules ("The Faces")
 * Structure: Six independent modules, one affixed to each face of the Core. Each module is a self-contained, three-dimensional computing system. A preferred embodiment comprises eight neuromorphic processing chips arranged in a 2x2x2 configuration, stacked and interconnected with TSVs, and managed by a local FPGA controller.
 * Function: The Faces act as sophisticated, programmable I/O controllers and specialized processing agents. They perform digital pre-processing on data before feeding it to the analog Core and post-process the analog results read out from the Core.
4.3. Hierarchical Functional Assignment
The six Facial Modules are assigned specialized roles to create a complete cognitive architecture:
 * Top Face (Executive Module): Implements top-down functions, including goal setting, strategic planning, and attentional biasing of the Core.
 * Bottom Face (Sensory Module): Implements bottom-up functions, processing raw sensory data streams from external sensors.
 * Front Face (External Module): Focuses on exteroception and interaction with the external environment, such as vision processing and spatial mapping.
 * Back Face (Internal Module): Implements Default Mode Network-like functionality, including internal state modeling, memory consolidation, and abstract simulation.
 * Left/Right Faces (Specialized Modules): Assigned to other dedicated tasks, such as language processing or social cognition modeling.
4.4. Method of Operation
In a typical operational cycle, the Bottom and Front Faces process raw external data. Simultaneously, the Top Face sets a high-level goal, which biases the computational properties of the Core. The processed sensory data and the goal-biasing signals are integrated within the Core as a single, massively parallel analog computation. The result represents a holistic "best fit" or inference, which is then read out by the appropriate Facial Modules for action or further internal processing by the Back Face.
5. Claims (For Patent Application)

 * The system of claim 2, wherein the six co-processor modules are assigned distinct, hierarchical functions, including a "top-down" executive control module and a "bottom-up" sensory processing module.

 * The system of claim 1, wherein each co-processor module comprises a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for managing the stacked array of neuromorphic chips.
 * The system of claim 1, wherein the analog memory elements of the central core are memristors.

   * Receiving a high-level goal at a first "top-down" co-processor module;
   * Receiving raw sensory data at a second "bottom-up" co-processor module;
   * Applying a biasing signal based on said high-level goal from the first co-processor to a central 3D analog core;
   * Applying a processed data signal based on said sensory data from the second co-processor to the central 3D analog core;
   * Performing an integrated, massively parallel analog computation on both signals within said central core to produce a result;
   * Reading out said result to one or more of the co-processor modules for action or further processing.
