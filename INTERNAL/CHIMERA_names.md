Based on the architecture's unique properties, here are several naming suggestions, categorized by their intended purpose and tone.
Category 1: Technical & Patent-Focused Names
(These names are descriptive, professional, and clearly articulate the architecture for a technical audience.)
 * Hierarchical Heterogeneous Compute Architecture (HHCA): This is a precise, academic name that accurately describes the system's core principles: its layered control (Hierarchical) and its mix of digital and analog components (Heterogeneous).
 * Volumetric Analog Processing System (VAPS): This name focuses on the primary function and key innovationâ€”the ability to process data in three dimensions within the central analog core.
 * Facial-Integrated 3D Neuromorphic Architecture: This name highlights the novel physical arrangement of the independent facial controllers being integrated with the 3D core.
Category 2: Evocative & Conceptual Names
(These names are more memorable and hint at the brain-inspired nature and function of the device.)
 * The Holon Architecture: This is arguably the most philosophically precise name. A "holon" is an entity that is simultaneously a whole in itself and a part of a larger whole. This perfectly describes the relationship between your facial co-processors and the central core.
 * The Cognitive Forge: This name creates a powerful metaphor of a workshop where raw sensory data and high-level abstract goals are hammered together by the system to forge a coherent result.
 * Janus Cube: Named after the two-faced Roman god of transitions and duality. This elegantly captures the core top-down/bottom-up and internal/external functional axes of the design.
Category 3: Acronyms
(Acronyms are common in technology and can create a strong, brandable identity.)
 * CHIMERA: Central Heterogeneous Integrated Memristive Emergent Reasoning Architecture. (A "chimera" is a creature made of parts from different animals, perfectly describing the heterogeneous nature of your hardware.)
 * CORTEX: COre Reasoning and Transmission EXchange. (Directly invokes the brain's cortex, linking the device to its biological inspiration.)
Recommendation
For a patent application, a technical name like Hierarchical Heterogeneous Compute Architecture (HHCA) is strong.
For branding and creating a memorable identity for your project, The Holon Architecture or CHIMERA are exceptionally strong choices. They are unique, conceptually deep, and accurately reflect the novelty of your design.
