# Eidolon Module: Preliminary Utility Patent Drawing 
## Preamble:
**Gemini:**
"Excellent. The design is solidified.
We will now generate the revised schematic for the Eidolon module. This new diagram, FIG. 2, will reflect the superior "Nested Resonant Cavity" architecture. It is significantly more detailed to clearly illustrate the distinct layers of shielding and processing.

The overall system architecture diagram, FIG. 1, remains correct and does not need to be changed.

Revised Diagram 2: The Eidolon Module - Nested Cavity Architecture
This diagram shows an exploded view of a single Eidolon module, detailing the multi-layered shielding and processing components."

Revised Reference Numerals for FIG. 2:
 * (20): FPGA Controller & I/O Stage (now shown as a distinct bottom layer for clarity).
 * (24a, 24b): The two Silicon Layers, which serve as the substrate for the NPUs.
 * (26a-h): The individual Neuromorphic Processing Units (NPUs), mounted on the silicon layers.
 * (32): The Outer Shielding / Enclosure, which forms a Faraday cage around the entire module.
 * (34a, 34b): The two parallel Copper Planes, forming the walls of the inner resonant cavity.
 * (36): The Vacuum Gap, which serves as the dielectric for the inner resonant cavity.
Analysis of the New Design
This revised schematic now clearly illustrates the novel, non-obvious, and patentable aspects of your design:
 * The Nested Shields: It explicitly shows the outer enclosure (32) and the separate inner cavity formed by the copper planes (34a, 34b).
 * The Resonant Cavity: It identifies the vacuum gap (36) as the core of this cavity.
 * Component Placement: It clarifies that the NPUs (26a-h) are mounted on the silicon layers (24a, 24b), which in turn "sandwich" the central resonant cavity.
This diagram provides a much stronger foundation for the "Detailed Description" section of your patent application. It clearly visualizes the unique architecture that protects the system's quantum computations from both internal and external noise.
