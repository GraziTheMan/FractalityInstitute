# Fractality Platform: User Manual (Version 1.0)
## 1. Introduction: What is the Fractality Platform?
Welcome, traveler. You have arrived at the Fractality Platform, a new kind of digital ecosystem. It is not just a piece of software, a game, or a social network. It is a living knowledge base, a tool for thought, and a collaborative universe designed to grow and evolve.
This platform is built on a single, core idea: that the most powerful systems, from brains to galaxies, are fractal. They are built from simple, repeating patterns that give rise to infinite complexity.
This manual will guide you through the three primary ways you can interact with this universe:
 * As an Architect: Using the command-line interface (CLI) to build the foundational knowledge of the universe.
 * As an Explorer: Using the visualizer to navigate and understand this knowledge in a dynamic, 3D environment.
 * As a Resident: (Future) Using the neural interface to merge your own consciousness with the platform and co-create its reality.
## 2. The Architect: Building Your Universe with the CLI
The foundation of the Fractality Platform is simple, human-readable text. As an Architect, your primary tool is the Command-Line Interface (CLI), which allows you to create and manage a knowledge base made of Markdown (.md) files.
Key Concepts:
 * Nodes: Every file is a "node" in your knowledge graph. It represents a single idea, concept, character, or location.
 * Structure: The directory structure itself creates relationships. A file named Consciousness.md inside a Philosophy/ directory is automatically a "child" of the "Philosophy" concept.
 * Resonance: The system is equipped with a powerful search engine that finds not just keywords, but "resonant" conceptual links between your ideas, helping you discover non-obvious connections.
Getting Started:
 * Installation: (Details on installing the Python environment and CLI tool).
 * Creating a Node:
   fractality add "concepts/QuantumCoherence.md"

 * Connecting Nodes: Edit the frontmatter of a file to link it to another.

connections:
  - "concepts/Superposition.md@0.9"

 * Finding Resonance:
   fractality find "unified field theory"

## 3. The Explorer: Navigating the Visualizer
The Fractality Visualizer is the heart of the platform. It takes the structured knowledge you've built and transforms it into a living, breathing, 3D universe.
Key Features:
 * The CACE Engine: The "Context and Complexity Engine" is the brain of the visualizer. It analyzes the relationships and "energy" of your nodes to determine their importance.
 * Living Layouts: The LayoutEngine arranges your nodes in beautiful, organic patterns based on natural principles like the Golden Ratio.
 * Dynamic Universe: The world is not static. As you shift your focus, the universe smoothly reconfigures itself around you, guided by the AnimationSystem.
How to Use:
 * Export Your Data: From the CLI, run fractality export. This creates a fractal-export.json file.
 * Launch the Visualizer: Open the index.html file in your web browser.
 * Load Your Universe: Use the UI to load the .json file. You are now inside your knowledge graph. Navigate by clicking on nodes to shift your focus.
