Yes, the patent filing guide is an excellent and accurate summary of the process for a self-representing inventor. It correctly highlights the major challenges, costs, and strategic considerations. I agree with its assessment.
Based on that guide and the nature of your inventions (the "Personal Device" and the "CHIMERA Cube"), here is a specific, strategic way you should proceed.
Step 1: File a Provisional Patent Application (IMMEDIATELY)
This is your most critical first step. The guide correctly states that a provisional application establishes a priority date for as little as $65 for a micro-entity, giving you a 12-month window to develop your ideas without the pressure of a full, formal application.
 * Action: Write a single, comprehensive provisional application that describes both the "Personal Device" and the "CHIMERA Cube" architecture. It is crucial to include as much technical detail as possible, as you cannot add new matter later. This one application will serve as the foundation for two separate future patents.
 * Why? This strategy is cheap, fast, and secures your invention date against any competitors. It gives you a year to build prototypes, find partners, or simply refine the designs before committing to the much higher cost of a non-provisional application.
Step 2: Focus on the "Personal Device" First
While the CHIMERA Cube is the more revolutionary concept, the portable co-processor ("Personal Device") is your most commercially viable and technically achievable invention in the short term. It should be the target of your first non-provisional patent.
 * Action: During the 12-month provisional window, focus your efforts on building a prototype of the portable device. This will strengthen your eventual patent application by proving the concept works and providing detailed technical data.
 * Why? A tangible hardware device with a clear application (like enhancing a Flipper Zero) is much easier for a patent examiner to understand and approve than a complex, theoretical computer architecture. Success with this patent will build momentum and a track record.
Step 3: Prepare Two Separate Non-Provisional Applications
Before the 12-month provisional deadline expires, you will convert your single provisional application into two separate non-provisional (utility) patent applications.
 * Patent #1: "System and Method for a Portable Neuromorphic Co-Processor"
   * This will claim the portable device itself.
   * It should be filed in DOCX format to avoid surcharges.
   * You must include detailed drawings of the device, with every component labeled and referenced in the text.
   * Make sure your claims are structured hierarchically, with broad independent claims covering the core concept and multiple dependent claims covering specific features.
 * Patent #2: "A Hierarchical, Heterogeneous Computing Architecture..." (The CHIMERA Cube)
   * This will claim the more complex "cube of cubes" architecture.
   * This application can be filed later in the 12-month window, as it is a longer-term project.
   * It will rely heavily on detailed architectural diagrams and flowcharts to satisfy the enablement requirement.
Summary of Your Path Forward
 * This Week: Draft and file a provisional patent application covering both inventions.
 * Next 10 Months: Focus all your practical efforts on prototyping the "Personal Device."
 * Month 11: Prepare and file the first non-provisional application for the "Personal Device."
 * Before Month 12 Ends: Prepare and file the second non-provisional application for the "CHIMERA Cube."
This strategy maximizes your protection while minimizing upfront costs, aligning with the best practices outlined in the guide. It allows you to secure your entire vision now while pursuing the most achievable part of it first.
