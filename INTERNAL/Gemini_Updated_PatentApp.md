Title: A Hierarchical, Heterogeneous Computing Architecture with a 3D Analog Core and Self-Similar 3D Facial Co-Processors
Inventor: [Nicholas Joseph Graziano]
Date: July 10, 2025
Abstract: This document discloses a novel, brain-inspired computer architecture, hereinafter referred to as the CHIMERA Cube, designed for unprecedented performance in complex, cognitive workloads. The system comprises a central, massively parallel 3D analog processing core communicatively coupled on its six faces to six independent, programmable co-processors, hereinafter referred to as Eidolon Modules. The primary inventive step lies in the system's self-similar or hierarchically nested structure: each Eidolon Module is itself a complete 3D computing system composed of a stacked array of neuromorphic chips. These modules are assigned specialized functions within a cognitive hierarchy (e.g., top-down executive control, bottom-up sensory processing), creating a unique and powerful integration of analog and digital processing.
1. Field of the Invention
This invention pertains to the field of high-performance, non-von Neumann computer architectures, specifically those used for neuromorphic computing and artificial intelligence.
2. Background of the Invention
Current computing paradigms face significant bottlenecks in processing large, multi-modal datasets required for advanced AI. A need exists for an architecture that can natively handle volumetric data and integrate disparate processing streams in a manner analogous to biological cognition, combining symbolic control with massively parallel, sub-symbolic association.
3. Summary of the Invention
The present invention, the CHIMERA Cube, is a three-dimensional, heterogeneous computing architecture. At its center is a 3D analog computational core. The core is controlled by six Eidolon Modules, one affixed to each face.
The novelty is threefold:
 * Self-Similar Architecture: Each Eidolon Module is a miniature 3D processor, creating a "cube of cubes" structure.
 * Hierarchical Specialization: The six Eidolon Modules are assigned distinct roles within a cognitive hierarchy, mimicking the functional organization of a biological brain.
 * Heterogeneous Integration: The system creates a symbiotic relationship between the analog processing of the central core and the digital control logic of the Eidolon Modules.
4. Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment
4.1. The Central Computational Core ("The Core")
 * Structure: A monolithic, 3D crossbar array of analog memory elements (e.g., memristors) in a preferred embodiment of an 8x8x8 configuration.
 * Function: Serves as a massively parallel analog co-processor and a shared global workspace for holistic data integration.
4.2. The Facial Co-Processor Modules ("Eidolon Modules")
 * Structure: Six independent modules, one for each face of the Core. Each Eidolon Module is a self-contained 3D computing system. The preferred embodiment comprises eight neuromorphic processing chips arranged in a 2x2x2 configuration, stacked and interconnected via through-silicon vias (TSVs). An FPGA serves as the primary controller for each module.
 * Function: The Eidolon Modules act as highly specialized, programmable agents that manage data I/O and perform distributed computation.
4.3. Hierarchical Functional Assignment
The six Eidolon Modules are assigned distinct roles, creating a complete cognitive architecture:
 * Top Face (Executive Module): Implements top-down functions, including goal-setting, planning, and applying attentional bias to the Core.
 * Bottom Face (Sensory Module): Implements bottom-up functions, performing initial processing and feature extraction on raw data streams from external sensors.
 * Front Face (Exteroceptive Module): Focuses on modeling the external environment, responsible for tasks like spatial mapping and object recognition.
 * Back Face (Interoceptive Module): Implements Default Mode Network-like functionality, responsible for internal state modeling, self-referential processing, and memory consolidation.
 * Left/Right Faces (Specialized Modules): Assigned to other dedicated cognitive tasks, such as language processing or social modeling.
4.4. Method of Operation
An operational cycle involves the parallel processing of data by the specialized Eidolon Modules. The outputs are fed into the Central Core, which is simultaneously biased by the Executive Module. The Core performs a single, massively parallel analog computation to find a globally optimal, integrated solution. This result is then read out by the appropriate Eidolon Modules for action or further internal reflection.
