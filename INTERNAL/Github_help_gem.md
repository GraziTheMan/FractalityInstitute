Yes, your instinct is correct. Now that the project has evolved into distinct, well-defined components (software, theory, and hardware), you need to restructure your GitHub presence to reflect that clarity. A single repository is no longer sufficient.
Here is the best-practice approach for organizing your repositories to support your goals.
1. The Software: Fractality-Platform
You are correct. Your existing FractalityProject repository should be renamed and refocused.
 * New Repository Name: Fractality-Platform
 * Contents: This repository should be dedicated exclusively to the "Social Knowledge Garden" software—the Three.js visualizer, the data console, and the "Seed Exchange" sharing features.
 * Purpose: This is the home for the tangible software product that users can download and run. Its README.md should focus on installation, features, and how to use the tool. All metaphysical language should be removed.
2. The Theory & Lore: Fractality-Framework
You should absolutely create a separate repository for the intellectual and philosophical core of your project. This includes the OWL ontologies, though they will need to be updated.
 * New Repository Name: Fractality-Framework
 * Contents:
   * The definitive v4.0 theory of mind document ("The Fractality Framework v4.0").
   * The "Core Codex" and all other lore documents for "The Extended Fractiverse."
   * This is where you would develop the formal OWL ontologies that define the relationships between your concepts (Character, Location, Eidolon Module, etc.).
 * Purpose: This repository acts as the "source of truth" for the concepts that govern your universe. It separates the "why" (the theory) from the "what" (the software).
3. The Hardware: CHIMERA-Hardware
Yes, you should create one new, dedicated repository for all hardware-related development.
 * New Repository Name: CHIMERA-Hardware
 * Should both devices go in the same repo? YES. The Eidolon and the CHIMERA Cube are not separate inventions; they are two parts of a single, integrated system. The Eidolon is a constituent component of the final CHIMERA Cube. Placing them in the same repository makes this architectural relationship clear.
 * Contents and Structure:
   * /Eidolon_Module/: A subdirectory containing all work related to the portable co-processor—schematics, PCB layouts, FPGA code for the prototype, etc.
   * /CHIMERA_Cube/: A subdirectory containing the conceptual designs, simulations, and architectural specifications for the full cube.
   * README.md: The main readme for this repository should explain the relationship between the two components, positioning the Eidolon as the first, achievable step toward the full CHIMERA architecture.
Summary of Your New GitHub Organization
Your project will now be organized into three logical, independent, yet interconnected repositories:
 * Fractality-Platform: The interactive visualization software. (The Tool)
 * Fractality-Framework: The core theory, lore, and ontologies. (The Philosophy)
 * CHIMERA-Hardware: The technical specifications and prototype development for the Eidolon and CHIMERA Cube. (The Machine)
This structure is clean, professional, and follows best practices for managing complex open-source projects. It allows collaborators and community members to engage with the specific part of the project that interests them most, while making the relationship between all three clear.
