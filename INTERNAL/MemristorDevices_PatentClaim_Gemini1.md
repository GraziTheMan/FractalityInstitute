## Proposal 1: 
A Portable, FPGA-Based Neuromorphic Co-Processor
Title: System and Method for a Portable, Bus-Powered Neuromorphic Co-Processor for Accelerated Pattern Recognition

### Abstract: 
This document discloses a system for a portable hardware accelerator designed to offload and accelerate adaptive pattern recognition and machine learning tasks from host devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and specialized hardware (e.g., SDRs). The system utilizes a novel architecture combining commercially available neuromorphic processing units with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) controller, delivered in a compact, bus-powered form factor with a standard high-speed data interface (USB-C).

### 1. Introduction: The Problem
Modern consumer electronics and embedded systems increasingly require sophisticated pattern recognition capabilities (e.g., signal analysis, image recognition, anomaly detection). These workloads are computationally intensive and are often ill-suited for traditional CPU/GPU architectures, leading to high power consumption and latency. A need exists for a portable, low-power, specialized co-processor that can efficiently handle these adaptive learning tasks.
### 2. System Architecture
The proposed device comprises the following key components:
 * Neuromorphic Processing Units (NPUs): A plurality of neuromorphic chips (e.g., Knowm SDC or similar memristor-based arrays) configured in a 2x2 or similar tiled layout. These NPUs serve as the core analog processing elements, performing in-memory computation for pattern matching and synaptic weight adaptation.
 * FPGA Controller: A central FPGA (e.g., Xilinx Zynq series) that serves as the high-level controller. Its responsibilities include:
   * Managing data flow between the host device and the NPUs.
   * Implementing low-level control and timing signals for the NPU array.
   * Executing pre-processing and post-processing algorithms on the data streams.
 * High-Speed Interface: A standard USB-C interface providing both a high-bandwidth data channel (USB 3.1 or greater) and sufficient power to operate the device (USB Power Delivery).
 * Physical Form Factor: A compact printed circuit board (PCB) housed in a portable enclosure with dimensions comparable to a standard smartphone.
3. Novelty and Inventive Steps (Patentability Claims)

The novelty of this system lies not in the individual components, but in their specific combination and application to create a new class of device:
 * Claim 1: A Portable Neuromorphic Co-Processor. The system architecture itself—a multi-chip NPU array managed by an FPGA in a bus-powered, portable enclosure—constitutes a novel apparatus for accelerating adaptive learning tasks on general-purpose computing devices.
 * Claim 2: Method for Host-Device Offloading. A method whereby a host device (e.g., a laptop or smartphone) identifies a computationally expensive pattern recognition task, offloads the relevant data stream to the portable co-processor via the USB-C interface, and receives the processed result, thereby reducing host CPU/GPU load and power consumption.
 * Claim 3: Application to Specialized Hardware. A specific application of the device wherein it is connected to a software-defined radio (SDR) or network analysis tool (e.g., Flipper Zero). The co-processor performs real-time, hardware-accelerated analysis of captured signals to identify complex, non-obvious patterns or protocols, a task not feasible on the host tool's embedded processor alone.

## Proposal 2: A Heterogeneous 3D High-Performance Computing Architecture

Title: A High-Performance Computing Architecture Combining a 3D Analog Processing Core with Multiple Programmable Digital Control Planes
Abstract: This document discloses a novel computer architecture designed for unprecedented performance on volumetric and large-scale matrix computations. The architecture features a dense, 3D array of analog processing elements (e.g., memristors) serving as a central computational core. This core is surrounded by multiple, parallel, programmable digital controllers, each responsible for managing data I/O and pre-processing for a specific face or dimension of the central core. This heterogeneous design provides a powerful division of labor between massively parallel analog computation and flexible digital control.

### 1. Introduction: The Von Neumann Bottleneck in 3D Computing

Fields such as medical imaging, scientific simulation, and artificial intelligence increasingly rely on processing large, volumetric datasets. Traditional computer architectures are limited by the von Neumann bottleneck—the separation of processing and memory—which becomes particularly severe when dealing with 3D data that must be "sliced" for processing by 2D chips. A need exists for a native 3D architecture that performs computation directly within a volumetric memory structure.

### 2. System Architecture
The proposed system is a cube-like structure with two primary component types:
 * The Computational Core (The "Cube"): A centrally located, three-dimensional array of analog memory elements (e.g., an 8x8x8 memristor crossbar array). This core is capable of performing massively parallel in-memory computations, such as matrix-vector multiplications, across its entire volume simultaneously. Its analog nature allows for high-density, low-power computation.
 * The Control Planes (The "Faces"): Six independent, programmable digital controllers (e.g., FPGA-based systems) affixed to the six faces of the central core. Each control plane is responsible for:
   * Managing data I/O for its corresponding face of the core.
   * Pre-processing data before it enters the core (e.g., digitization, normalization).
   * Post-processing analog results read out from the core.
   * Coordinating with other control planes to execute complex algorithms.
3. Novelty and Inventive Steps (Patentability Claims)

The inventive concept is the heterogeneous, multi-plane control system for a 3D analog computational core.
 * Claim 1: A Heterogeneous 3D Computing Architecture. The system itself, comprising a 3D analog computational core interfaced with a plurality of independent, programmable digital control planes (one for each face), constitutes a novel computer architecture.
 * Claim 2: A Method for Parallel I/O and Control. A method of operation where multiple, independent data streams are simultaneously managed by the facial control planes, prepared for processing, fed into the 3D core, and their results are read out and post-processed in parallel. This enables a unique form of spatial and pipeline parallelism not possible in monolithic designs.
 * Claim 3: Method for Volumetric Computation. A method for performing a 3D convolution or other volumetric computation, wherein the 3D data kernel is loaded into the core and the input data is streamed through the core via the facial planes, with the entire computation occurring as a single, massively parallel analog operation within the 3D memory structure. This provides a significant performance and efficiency advantage over traditional methods.
