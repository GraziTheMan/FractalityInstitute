Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment
The Eidolon Personal AI Augmentation Module (10) is a portable, low-power neuromorphic co-processor. Its enclosure (12) is constructed from a conductive material to provide a Faraday cage effect, shielding the internal components from electromagnetic interference (EMI).
The core processing is performed by four Neuromorphic Processing Units (NPUs) (16a-d), which are mounted on a common silicon substrate (14). In the preferred embodiment, each NPU (16) is comprised of one or more 8x8 memristor crossbar arrays, such as those developed by Knowm Inc., capable of performing low-power analog computation.
Overall control, data routing between the NPUs (16a-d), and external communication are managed by a low-power Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) and its associated components, which are housed on a central Printed Circuit Board (PCB) (18).
To manage thermal load, the enclosure (12) is coupled to a heat dissipation means (20), which may take the form of a passive finned heat sink, a thermal interface pad, or a more active cooling solution, ensuring the module remains within its optimal operating temperature range during sustained use.
