Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment
The CHIMERA Cube System (60) is a massively parallel, neuromorphic computing architecture. The system is comprised of a Central Computational Core (52) and six facially-mounted Eidolon Prime Modules (50a-f).
The Central Computational Core (52) is a three-dimensional, volumetric memristor crossbar array capable of performing large-scale analog in-memory computation.
Each of the six faces of the Central Core (52) is communicatively coupled to a dedicated Eidolon Prime Module (50a-f). As detailed in FI-PAT-002, each Eidolon Prime is a high-performance co-processor responsible for specialized data processing tasks.
In the preferred embodiment, the modules are assigned hierarchical roles: one module (e.g., 50a) acts as the executive controller, while the others handle specific sensory or logical domains. This architecture allows for a hierarchical and parallel processing scheme, where specialized data is pre-processed by the facial modules before being integrated and acted upon by the central core, mimicking the distributed yet unified nature of biological consciousness.
