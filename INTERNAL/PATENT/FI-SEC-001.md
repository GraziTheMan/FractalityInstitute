# FI-SEC-001: The Asphodel Protocol (Operational Security & Radical Transparency)
1.0 Introduction: The Two Pillars
The Asphodel Protocol, named for the flower that symbolizes both finality and the separation of realms, defines the Institute's approach to information security. It is built on two core, non-negotiable principles:
 * Radical Transparency of Ideas: All scientific frameworks, theoretical models, and software code will be made public and open source under the appropriate licenses (FI-IP-001). Knowledge must be free.
 * Absolute Security of Persons and Operations: All personal, financial, legal, and operational data will be subject to strict security protocols to protect the privacy and safety of our members and the integrity of the Institute.
The key to this protocol is understanding that there is a firewall between the world of ideas and the world of personal, operational data.
2.0 What We Share (The Public Realm)
This is the information that defines the intellectual and creative output of the Institute. It is designed to be shared.
 * All Formal Documents: Every FI- designated document (Theories, Protocols, White Papers, Charters) will be publicly accessible.
 * All Source Code: The code for the Fractality-Platform, CHIMERA-Hardware prototypes, and other tools will be maintained in public repositories.
 * Anonymized Research Data: Any scientific data used for our research projects will be fully anonymized to remove all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before being shared.
3.0 What We Protect (The Private Realm)
This is the information required to run the Institute and protect its members. It is never made public.
 * Personal Identity: The real-world identities of members, contributors, and directors are protected. Public interaction will be conducted through handles or pseudonyms (e.g., "FractiGrazi").
 * Legal & Financial Data: All documents related to the incorporation of the Institute, its bank accounts, tax filings, and internal financial records are strictly confidential.
 * Operational Security: The physical locations of servers, prototypes, and the home addresses of members are considered highly sensitive operational data.
 * Private Communications: Internal discussions on the "mod-chat" of the Discord server or in private email are confidential.
4.0 Conclusion: A Secure Foundation for Open Ideas
This protocol demonstrates that transparency and security are not mutually exclusive. By creating a clear and impenetrable firewall between our public ideas and our private operations, we can build a community that is both radically open and completely secure. We can share our vision with the world without exposing our members to unnecessary risk. This is the only logical and ethical way to proceed.
