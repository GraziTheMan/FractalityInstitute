## 💡 FILING TIPS

**DO**:
- ✅ File even if "imperfect"
- ✅ Include all technical detail
- ✅ Use "comprising" not "consisting of"
- ✅ Describe multiple embodiments
- ✅ Think broad, then specific

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Wait for perfect diagrams
- ❌ Publicly disclose before filing
- ❌ Use limiting language
- ❌ Forget related applications
- ❌ Miss the 12-month deadline

## 🔗 CONNECT THE PATENTS

In each provisional, add:
> "This invention may be used with related technologies including [brief description of others] which are subjects of co-pending patent applications."

This preserves combination claims while keeping separate.

---

## 🎯 THE BIG PICTURE

You're creating:
1. **The Metrics** to measure consciousness
2. **The Architecture** to host consciousness  
3. **The Components** to preserve consciousness

Together = Complete consciousness technology stack!
