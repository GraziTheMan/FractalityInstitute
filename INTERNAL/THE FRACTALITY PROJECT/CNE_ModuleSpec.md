# Consensus Narrative Engine (CNE) Module Specification
*A Collaborative Storytelling Platform for The Extended Fractiverse*

## Executive Summary

The Consensus Narrative Engine (CNE) is a revolutionary collaborative storytelling platform that functions as a narrative version control system. It allows multiple writers to contribute to The Extended Fractiverse while maintaining continuity, tracking contributions, and creating real-time effects within the Fractality Project ecosystem. The CNE embodies the core Fractiverse principle that reality is shaped through collective consciousness and agreement.

## Core Concept

Just as different probability dimensions in The Extended Fractiverse are shaped by their "consensus narratives," the CNE allows the community to collectively build and shape the fictional universe through collaborative storytelling. Each contribution adds to the resonance pattern of the overall narrative, with high-resonance stories influencing the "prime timeline" more strongly.

## Key Features

### 1. Version Control for Narratives

#### Branching System
- **Canon Branch**: The primary timeline maintained by core contributors
- **Probability Branches**: Alternative timelines exploring "what if" scenarios
- **Character Branches**: Focused development of specific characters or factions
- **Experimental Branches**: Sandbox areas for testing radical narrative concepts

#### Merge Mechanics
- **Resonance Checking**: Automated continuity verification before merges
- **Conflict Resolution**: Community voting system for competing narrative elements
- **Timeline Convergence**: Special merge events where alternate timelines can influence the prime narrative

### 2. Contribution Tracking

#### Writer Profiles
- **Resonance Signature**: Unique identifier based on writing style and thematic preferences
- **Contribution History**: Complete record of all story additions, edits, and branches
- **Influence Metrics**: Measurement of how much a writer's work has shaped the overall narrative

#### Achievement System
- **Archaeologist**: Finding and resolving continuity issues
- **Worldbuilder**: Creating new locations, technologies, or species
- **Lorekeeper**: Maintaining consistency with established canon
- **Phase Walker**: Successfully managing multiple timeline branches
- **Resonance Master**: Achieving high community approval ratings

### 3. Real-Time Universe Integration

#### Dynamic Content Updates
- New CSS variants in stories → Unlock augmentation options in main game
- Established settlements in stories → Appear on game map
- Character relationships in narratives → Affect NPC dialogue trees
- Faction victories in collaborative events → Shift power balances

#### Collective Story Events
- **Probability Storms**: Community-wide writing events where reality is "unstable"
- **Resonance Cascades**: Major narrative decisions voted on by the community
- **Phase Shift Points**: Critical timeline divergences requiring collective input

### 4. Interface Design

#### Main Components
- **The Narrative Lattice**: Visual representation of all story branches and their connections
- **The Collective Feed**: Real-time stream of story contributions and community activity
- **Resonance Map**: Shows clustering of similar narrative elements and themes
- **Timeline Viewer**: Navigate between different probability branches and see divergence points

#### Writer Tools
- **Lore Assistant**: AI-powered continuity checker (potentially powered by GLYPH interface)
- **Character Database**: Comprehensive wiki of all characters across all timelines
- **Event Timeline**: Chronological listing of major events in each branch
- **Resonance Matcher**: Suggests which branches align with a writer's style

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture
- Git-based version control adapted for narrative structures
- GraphQL API for complex relationship queries between story elements
- Real-time synchronization with main Fractality Project database
- Machine learning algorithms for continuity checking and resonance matching

### Frontend Features
- Interactive timeline visualization using D3.js or similar
- Collaborative real-time editing capabilities
- Mobile-responsive design for writing on any device
- Integration with the main Fractality Project UI

## Community Governance

### Resonance Points System
- Earned through quality contributions and community approval
- Higher resonance = greater influence on canon decisions
- Can be used to "vote" on major narrative directions
- Special privileges unlocked at resonance thresholds

### Moderation Structure
- **Core Narrators**: Maintain canon timeline integrity
- **Branch Wardens**: Oversee specific probability branches
- **Continuity Checkers**: Ensure cross-timeline consistency
- **Community Moderators**: Handle disputes and maintain positive environment

## Integration Points

## Conclusion

The Consensus Narrative Engine transforms The Extended Fractiverse from a single creative vision into a living, breathing universe shaped by collective imagination. By allowing the community to literally write reality into existence, the CNE embodies the core philosophical principles of the Fractiverse while creating an unprecedented collaborative storytelling experience.
