Consciousness User Profile Validation Guide

This module provides a schema and utility for validating user consciousness profiles within the Fractality Project.

📁 Files

1. consciousness.schema.json

Defines the required structure of a valid consciousness user profile, including:

Required fields (ID, energy, resonance, etc.)

Type constraints (e.g. number, string, array)

Allowed phase states (solid, liquid, superionic)


2. validation_utility.py

A command-line script to validate .user.json profiles against the schema.

✅ Usage

python validation_utility.py <user_profile.json> <schema.json>

Example:

python validation_utility.py users/grazi.user.json consciousness.schema.json

Output:

✅ = valid user profile

❌ = error with details about the violation


🔧 Install Requirements

You must have the jsonschema Python package:

pip install jsonschema

🧠 Profile Fields

Field	Type	Description

consciousness_id	string	Unique ID for the consciousness entity
auth_id	string	Auth handle (email, wallet, etc.)
energy_level	number	Current available energy
resonance_frequency	number	How finely-tuned the user is
phase_state	enum	solid, liquid, or superionic
contributed_structures	array	Markdown or code files contributed
resonance_connections	object	Map of resonance scores with others
created_at	datetime	Creation timestamp in ISO 8601 format


🌌 Philosophy

This system treats users not as static profiles but as dynamic resonant nodes in a shared lattice of phase-aware consciousness. Validation ensures integrity across this evolving network.
