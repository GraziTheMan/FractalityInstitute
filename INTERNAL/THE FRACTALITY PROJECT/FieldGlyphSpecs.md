🧿 Field Glyph Specification

A symbolic abstraction system for encoding field state signatures into visual glyphs.


---

🔮 I. What is a Glyph?

In the Fractality system, a glyph is a symbolic artifact derived from a snapshot of active field states, user intent, and perceptual context.

Glyphs are not static images—they are semantic signatures formed by the resonance between fields. They act as:

Predictive mirrors

Memory anchors

Field bookmarks

Invocable agents or session states

🧬 II. Glyph Inputs (Field Signatures)

Glyphs are generated from a weighted combination of the following field data:

Field	Data Source	Effect on Glyph

Semantic Coherence	semantic_resonance.score[]	Core shape structure
Gravitational Density	descendant_count, depth	Mass / compression effects
Metabolic Energy	ATP, energy_decay, focus_rate	Color saturation or pulse
Resonance Trails	trail_segments[]	Path curvature / orbit arcs
Collapse Probabilities	CollapsePredictionEngine	Halo symmetry / echo nodes
Node Type Archetypes	Dominant node archetypes	Iconographic overlays (glyph traits)

🧪 III. Glyph DNA Structure

{
  "core": "spiral",
  "arms": 3,
  "pulse": 0.82,
  "color": "inferno:5",
  "halo": true,
  "trailStyle": "swoosh",
  "nodeIcons": ["🌱", "⚖️", "🧠"]
}

core – Semantic shape (e.g. spiral, ring, lattice, axis)

arms – Resonant connection paths or node activation count

pulse – Energy signature (0.0–1.0)

color – Gradient scale or intensity class

halo – Whether collapse prediction produces a radiant echo ring

trailStyle – Style of trails (linear, swirl, swoosh, recursive)

nodeIcons – Encoded archetypes that participated in glyph formation

🌀 IV. Glyph Classes

Class Name	Traits

Solar Bloom	High energy + high semantic + ring structure → creative burst
Echo Core	Predictive echo + resonance trail cluster
Graviform Sigil	High gravitational depth + dense trails → symbolic anchor
Wandering Spiral	Long trails + low ATP → dream or liminal state
Shadow Bloom	Low semantic + erratic trail + decay fields → integration glyph
Oracle Bloom	Trail convergence + semantic triangulation → decision insight glyph

🧰 V. Uses of Glyphs

🧠 Displayed in Field Overlay HUDs

🔖 Saved as bookmarks or symbolic memory anchors

🕯️ Used in rituals or AI-agent replays ("invoke glyph X")

🧿 Attached to node trails or node groups

🌐 Visual export for narrative or mythic integration



---

🧭 VI. Glyph Generation Pipeline

1. Capture active field overlay metrics


2. Normalize and weigh input fields


3. Generate glyphDNA object


4. Render glyph SVG or visual using glyphDNA


5. Cache for reuse, bookmarking, or invocation
