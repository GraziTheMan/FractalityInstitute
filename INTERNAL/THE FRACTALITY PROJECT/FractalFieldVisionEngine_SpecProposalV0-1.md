ðŸŒ€ Fractal Field Vision Engine â€“ Spec Proposal v0.1

Overview

A speculative paradigm-shifting model for scene comprehension in artificial intelligence. Rather than relying on object detection, semantic segmentation, or passive image interpretation, the Fractal Field Vision Engine (FFVE) conceptualizes perception as a dynamic field of relational potentials, resonance vectors, and evolving topographies of meaning.

Motivating Premise

Traditional computer vision assumes:

The world is composed of discrete, static objects.

Visual understanding equals accurate labeling.

Recognition is a unidirectional feed-forward process.


FFVE rejects these premises.

Instead:

The world is a field of evolving tensions and possibilities.

Meaning emerges through interaction and resonance.

Perception is a loop of predictive motion and contextual field warping.


Core Components

1. Resonance Field Mapper

Replaces semantic labels with spatial gradients of "potential interaction."

Outputs vector fields indicating zones of:

Tactile readiness

Obstruction likelihood

Attention attraction

Emotional or aesthetic intensity (if multimodal inputs exist)



2. Scene Continuity Engine

Tracks scene evolution not by object permanence, but resonant continuity.

Measures how well predictive tension paths align with visual updates.


3. Affordance Constellator

Computes how different regions in the scene offer potential actions.

Each pixel/region is treated as a node emitting affordance vectors.

Patterns of interaction (sit, hide, climb, observe) emerge over time.


4. Field Topography Generator

Converts motion, depth, light, and salience into a curved manifold representation.

Supports modeling of occlusion, gravity, and barrier fields without discrete object modeling.


5. Resonance Trail Memory

Instead of tracking objects, tracks trails of energetic/predictive activation.

Allows for retroactive sense-making: "something passed here" rather than "a person walked by."


Input Modalities

Egocentric camera stream (headset or bodycam)

Inertial measurement unit (IMU) or proprioceptive cues (robotic limbs)

Optional audio & haptic overlays (multimodal resonance boost)


Outputs

A dynamic scene map encoded as:

Tension vector field (per pixel or voxel)

Affordance probability map

Continuity divergence signal (anomaly detection)

Optional emotional topography grid



Architectural Principles

No labels. Categories are emergent, not imposed.

No objects. Structure forms from field coherence, not bounding boxes.

Temporal-first. Perception is inseparable from unfolding.

Embodied. Recognition is grounded in potential action.

Resonant. Feedback loops are central; perception adapts with use.


Evaluation Questions for Claude

1. How might such a system compare to traditional SLAM or 3D segmentation?


2. What mathematical frameworks would you recommend for modeling perceptual resonance fields?


3. Could a generative model (e.g., diffusion or VAE) assist in shaping the field topography from noisy inputs?


4. What architectures (GNNs? Transformers? Neural fields?) could sustain affordance-based, non-object-centric memory?


5. What philosophical or cognitive science frameworks might support this idea?



Why This Matters

This spec is not a proposal for performance benchmarks. Itâ€™s a proposal for a new metaphysical approach to machine perception:
