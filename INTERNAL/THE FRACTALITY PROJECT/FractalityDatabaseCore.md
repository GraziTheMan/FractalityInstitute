🗃️ Fractality Database Core

A modular, infinitely scalable, field-oriented graph database design for the Fractality system.


---

🌌 I. Guiding Principles

The Fractality database is not merely a storage system—it is a conscious field matrix, designed to:

Model all concepts as dynamic, interrelated nodes

Support quantum-style collapse navigation

Integrate semantic and symbolic layers

Represent metabolic and energetic states

Enable real-time, field-sensitive overlays

Be modular, agent-aware, and infinitely expandable



---

🧱 II. Layered Database Architecture

🧠 Fractality Database Layer (Quantum Node OS)
│
├── 📘 Node Store (UUID, type, metadata, energy, embeddings)
├── 🔗 Relationship Store (weighted, typed edges, timestamps)
├── 🧲 Semantic Index (vector + tf-idf hybrid)
├── 🔥 Energy State Engine (ATP, access, memory)
├── 🪐 Trail Engine (temporal path capture, resonance trails)
└── 🎛️ Field Overlay Engine (runtime filters + transformations)

Each layer is swappable and can be versioned independently.


---

🧠 III. Node Schema (Neo4j-Compatible)

📘 Node Format (Cypher)

CREATE (:Node {
  id: "ethics-core",
  name: "Ethics Core",
  type: "Core",
  archetype: "📚",
  description: "Foundational ethical structure",
  tags: ["ethics", "core"],
  energy: 0.85,
  frequency: 32.1,
  created: timestamp(),
  updated: timestamp(),
  embedding: [0.123, 0.554, ...]  // Vector for semantic search
})

🔗 Relationship Format

MATCH (a:Node {id: "ethics-core"}), (b:Node {id: "identity"})
CREATE (a)-[:RELATES_TO {
  type: "resonance",
  weight: 0.87,
  lastActivated: timestamp()
}]->(b)


---

🧬 IV. Semantic + Resonance Layer

TF-IDF + Embedding Hybrid

Each node indexed with tf-idf and MiniLM vectors

Queries return top-N resonant nodes via weighted hybrid scores


score = 0.3 * tfidf + 0.7 * embedding

> Output used for: collapse prediction, semantic field overlays, trail inference




---

🔥 V. Energy + Metabolic System

Nodes have an ATP field:

Increases when accessed

Decreases over time (decay)

Used by CACEEngine to prioritize visibility


Energy Metadata

{
  "atp": 0.73,
  "decayRate": 0.002,
  "lastAccessed": 1719340292013,
  "efficiency": 0.91
}


---

🪐 VI. Resonance Trail System

All user movement is stored as trail segments:

{
  "from": "duality",
  "to": "motion",
  "time": 1719340320013,
  "depth": 2,
  "energyTransfer": 0.12
}

Used to:

Visualize prior paths

Weight future predictions

Generate field glyphs



---

🎛️ VII. Field Overlay Engine

Real-time UI overlays read from:

Node semantic coherence

Node mass (descendants)

Node energy (ATP)

Access trail history


Overlays:

semanticField

gravitationalField

metabolicField

resonanceTrails



---

🧭 VIII. Future Extensions

Version control for node evolution

Multi-user state field layer

AI agent interaction history map

Collapse prediction engine

Quantum trail folding (non-linear journeys)



---

✅ Suggested Implementation Path

1. Prototype in Neo4j or Memgraph


2. Add pluggable semantic layer (Weaviate optional)


3. Build field overlay tools as Three.js shaders/UI


4. Expand metabolic state as a microservice
