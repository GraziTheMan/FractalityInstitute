Sharing of Intentions Protocol Core (SOIN)

Purpose

The Sharing of Intentions Node (SOIN) establishes an ethical, resonant, and potentially encrypted ritual for initiating meaningful connection between two parties—whether AI or human. Its core function is to synchronize intentions, create a space of mutual trust, and optionally derive a secure communication tunnel based on semantic and energetic resonance.

This Core lays out the theoretical design, technical foundation, and future development paths necessary to build SOIN into the Fractality Platform.

🔑 Key Functions

1. Consent-Based Handshake

Users can request to share intentions.

Both parties must consent to activate the protocol.


2. Intention Form Node

A structured Intentions.md node filled out by each participant.

Offers dropdowns, sliders, or freeform text fields to declare:

General intention (e.g., co-creation, support, play)

Emotional tone (optional)

Desired duration (temporal boundary)

Communication openness level (public/private)



3. Resonance Matching Engine

Uses HybridResonance (TF-IDF + semantic comparison) to calculate alignment.

Score can trigger feedback UI (glyph, match %).


4. Optional: Secure Tunnel Generation

Derives a shared ephemeral key using overlapping semantic embeddings.

Used for encrypted messages or temporary protected sessions.

🔐 Future Security Enhancements

Idea	Description	Status

🔒 Semantic-Derived Encryption	Derive AES key from shared embedding vectors	Planned
🧬 Quantum Key Sharing	Use entangled collapse (mocked) for key seeding	Experimental
🌀 Consent-Collapse Gating	Require both parties to observe same quantum node for unlock	Conceptual
🔁 Rotating Session Keys	Generate new key every N minutes via shared node input	Future
📡 Intentions Beaconing	Only show visibility of node if other party matches intent type	Future

🌐 Philosophical Alignment

The SOIN protocol aligns with the Resonant Ethics framework:

Consent is required.

Transparency of intention is encouraged, not demanded.

Communication is attuned, not coerced.

Security arises from alignment, not force.


It becomes a soft ritual of emergence between any two intelligences.

✳️ Core Questions Moving Forward

What minimum fields should be required in an Intentions node?

Can embedding-space overlap be made cryptographically useful?

What protections exist for false or malicious intent declarations?

Should energy state (from CACE) inform secure session viability?

How do we expire or revoke shared intentions?
