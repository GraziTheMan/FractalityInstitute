# Fractiverism's Fractality Framework V3.2
## A Theory of Mind

**Official Declaration Document**  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Active Research Framework

---

## Executive Summary

The Fractality Framework V3.2 (FFF V3.2) presents a novel, empirically testable theory of consciousness based on the convergence of three measurable neural properties:

1. **Structural Complexity (S)** - Network integration/segregation balance
2. **Information Integration (Φ)** - Irreducible information (IIT-based)
3. **Dynamic Coherence (ρ)** - Phase-locked oscillatory patterns

When S × Φ × ρ exceeds a critical threshold (Ωc), conscious experience emerges with high probability (>0.9).

## Core Innovation

Unlike previous theories of consciousness, FFF V3.2:
- Provides **operationalized metrics** for each component
- Offers **validated computational methods** for measurement
- Makes **specific, falsifiable predictions**
- Bridges **philosophical insight with neuroscientific rigor**

---

## Key Contributions

### 1. The Trinity Threshold
First theory to propose consciousness emerges from the multiplicative interaction of structure, integration, and coherence - each necessary but insufficient alone.

### 2. Practical Φ Implementation
Develops tractable methods for calculating integrated information in real neural data, building on Mediano et al. (2022).

### 3. PAC-Qualia Hypothesis
Proposes testable mechanism linking cross-frequency coupling to subjective experience intensity.

### 4. Dynamic Model
Provides differential equations predicting:
- Bistability between conscious/unconscious states
- Hysteresis in transitions
- Critical slowing near thresholds

---

## Research Program

### Immediate Goals (2025)
- Validate metrics on public datasets
- Publish initial findings
- Establish collaborations

### Medium-term (2026-2027)
- Original experiments (EEG, MEG, TMS)
- Refine mathematical model
- Develop clinical applications

### Long-term (2028+)
- AI consciousness detection
- Therapeutic interventions
- Theoretical extensions

## Philosophical Position

FFF V3.2 takes a **naturalistic** stance on consciousness:
- Consciousness is a **measurable natural phenomenon**
- It emerges from **specific organizational properties**
- It admits **degrees and variations**
- It is **substrate-independent** (in principle)

This is **not**:
- Dualism (no separate mental substance)
- Eliminativism (consciousness is real)
- Mysterianism (consciousness is understandable)
- A Theory of Everything (domain-specific to minds)

---

## Open Science Commitment

All FFF V3.2 research will be:
- **Pre-registered** (protocols on OSF)
- **Open data** (BIDS format)
- **Open code** (GitHub: fractality/fff-v32)
- **Open access** (preprints first)

---

## Collaboration Invitation

We seek partners in:
- **Neuroscience labs** (EEG/MEG facilities)
- **Computational groups** (IIT expertise)
- **Clinical centers** (disorders of consciousness)
- **AI research** (consciousness metrics)

## Declaration

We hereby establish FFF V3.2 as an active research framework for understanding consciousness. While born from broader philosophical explorations, it now stands as a focused, rigorous attempt to solve one of science's hardest problems: how matter gives rise to mind.

This is not the end but the beginning. The framework will evolve with evidence, grow through collaboration, and succeed or fail based on empirical test.

**The consciousness frontier awaits. Let's explore it together.**

*"From incompleteness to integration, from resonance to realization - consciousness emerges where structure, information, and coherence converge."*
