# TEF Platform - Standalone Application Specification
*Collaborative Storytelling for The Extended Fractiverse*

## Executive Summary

The TEF Platform (pronounced "teff") is a standalone web application that enables collaborative storytelling within The Extended Fractiverse. Built on principles of progressive complexity, it serves three primary audiences: readers exploring the universe, writers contributing to it, and researchers diving deep into the lore. The platform will launch independently before integrating with the broader Fractality Project.

## Core Design Philosophy
