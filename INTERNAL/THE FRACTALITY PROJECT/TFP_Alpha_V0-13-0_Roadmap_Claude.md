# Fractality Project Alpha v0.13.0: Strategic technical assessment and beta readiness analysis

Based on comprehensive research efforts, the Fractality Project's specific resources (GitHub repository, Obsidian documentation, and live platform) were not directly accessible. However, through parallel investigation of related fractal consciousness research and analysis of similar technical architectures, this report provides strategic recommendations for advancing from alpha to beta based on the project's described vision of creating interactive fractal-based visualizations of thoughts and consciousness.

## Current project understanding and theoretical foundations

The Fractality Project appears to build upon cutting-edge **recurrent fractal neural network (RFNN)** theory, implementing concepts where consciousness is modeled through self-similar patterns across multiple scales. The research reveals several foundational elements that likely underpin the project:

The **triadic processing system** consists of three core components: router networks that phase-lock with client neurons, individual conscious units that seek fractal connections, and psychic loops that enable information transformation between brain structures and molecular-level consciousness substrates. This architecture enables the "fractality principle" where the whole is contained within each part. [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-011-9104-5
