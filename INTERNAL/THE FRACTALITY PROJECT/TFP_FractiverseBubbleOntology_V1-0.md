# 🫧 Fractiverse Bubble Ontology – Nested Structure

## 🌌 The Fractiverse
- The total ontological container.
- All other bubbles exist entirely within this.

### ⚫ Duality
- Primary split within the Fractiverse: foundational tension.

#### 🔁 Motion
- The active, dynamic principle.
- **Contains:**
  - Spatial Dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, etc.)
  - Temporal Flow
  - **Dimension of Mind**
    - Abstract cognition, pattern recognition, resonance navigation.
    - **Contains:**
      - **Multiverse**
        - All potential realities, timelines, and ontological branches.
        - **Contains:**
          - **Observable Universe**
            - Our local physical instantiation of reality.
            - Includes spacetime, matter, and measurable laws.

#### 🧊 Stillness
- The latent, decaying, or potential-bound principle.
- **Contains:**
  - **Entropy**
    - Thermodynamic dissipation.
    - Loss of structure and usable energy.

##### 🌪️ Chaos
- Emerges at the **boundary between Stillness and Motion**.
- A membrane of unpredictable interaction.
- Neither fully contained nor containing—exists as a liminal interface.
