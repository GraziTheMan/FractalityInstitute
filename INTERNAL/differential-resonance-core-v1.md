# Differential Resonance Core

## Substrate Definition

The neutral substrate S is a structure of distinctions D, their resonances R, and transformation rules T:
```
S = ⟨D, R, T⟩
R(d₁, d₂) = cos(θ) · e^(-λ|d₁ - d₂|²)
```

- D: Distinctions
- R: Resonance operator
- T: Distinction transformation rules

## Use

This substrate gives rise to:
- **Fractiverse**: Stable distinctions (structure)
- **Fractality**: Attention-guided transformation
- **Resonance Fields**: Local coherence gradients
