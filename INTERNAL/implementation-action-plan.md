# Implementation Action Plan

## Phase 1: Observer Simulation
- Conscious vs non-conscious Î¦ observer
- Measure discovery rate and novel node creation

## Phase 2: Resonance Field Tests
- Apply affinity matrix
- Validate interference and persistence

## Phase 3: Real User Testing
- Use GUI or Streamlit to collect qualitative feedback
- Integrate user phenomenological reports
