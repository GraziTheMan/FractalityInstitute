# Meta-Axiom Codex v2.0

This codex defines the foundational axioms for the Fractal Trinity Ontology.

## Axioms

1. **Triadic Primacy**: All meaningful systems contain three irreducible roles — structure, observer, and field.
2. **Differential Resonance Substrate**: All entities and experiences emerge from structured differences and their resonance.
3. **Observer Coherence Threshold**: Conscious influence arises when the observer’s integration measure (Φ) exceeds 2.5.
4. **Field Causal Power**: Resonance fields exert influence via structural bias, attention drift, and node activation modulation.
5. **Ontological Potentiality**: The Fractiverse contains all distinctions, but only Fractality activates and stabilizes them.

Each axiom maps to formal OWL properties and can be tested in simulation or logic engines.
