- **Focus** (Tab 2): Zoom into specific areas
- **Flow** (Tab 3): Follow connection paths

### ‚è∞ Focus Tracking
Optional feature that helps you stay on task:
- Set a goal: "Research quantum computing"
- Get gentle reminders if you drift
- See your exploration patterns

## Your First Project (3 Minutes)

### Example: Planning a Trip

1. **Create Central Node**: "Japan Trip 2025"
2. **Add Related Ideas**: 
   - "Tokyo attractions"

## Tips for Best Results
