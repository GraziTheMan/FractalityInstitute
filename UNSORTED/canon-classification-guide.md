## The Quick Classification Test

When you have a new idea, ask these questions in order:

### 1. Can it be measured? → Canon I (Empirical)
- Is there data or could data be collected?
- Can you design an experiment to test it?
- Are there numbers, statistics, or observations?
- Could it be peer-reviewed by scientists?

**Example**: "n-HAp particles of 20-40nm integrate into enamel structure"

### 2. Can it be built? → Canon II (Engineering)
- Is it a device, system, or process?
- Does it have specifications?
- Could an engineer make it?
- Does it solve a practical problem?

**Example**: "A microfluidic chip delivering n-HAp at 50μL/min"

### 3. Is it a conceptual framework? → Canon III (Speculative)
- Is it a way of thinking about something?
- Does it explain patterns without proof?
- Is it philosophically interesting?
- Does it generate questions more than answers?

**Example**: "Teeth might be crystallized information patterns"

### 4. Is it a story or vision? → Canon IV (Narrative)
- Does it explore "what if"?
- Is it about human experience?
- Does it inspire or imagine?
- Is truth less important than meaning?

**Example**: "In 2045, a healer helps bodies remember how to regenerate"

## Common Classification Pitfalls

### ❌ The "Quantum" Trap
**Wrong**: "Quantum effects make teeth regenerate" → Canon I
**Right**: "We hypothesize quantum coherence might influence stem cells" → Canon III

### ❌ The "Ancient Wisdom" Error
**Wrong**: "Traditional healers prove consciousness heals" → Canon I
**Right**: "Traditional practices suggest consciousness factors worth investigating" → Canon III

### ❌ The "It Works" Confusion
**Wrong**: "This device uses morphogenetic fields" → Canon II
**Right**: "This device uses ultrasound at 28kHz" → Canon II

### ❌ The "Future Fact" Mistake
**Wrong**: "In 10 years we will regenerate teeth with thought" → Canon I
**Right**: "Imagine a future where consciousness assists regeneration" → Canon IV

## The Classification Flowchart

```
NEW IDEA
    ↓
Is it testable/measurable?
    YES → Canon I (Empirical)
    NO ↓
    
Can it be built/implemented?
    YES → Canon II (Engineering)
    NO ↓
    
Is it a logical framework/model?
    YES → Canon III (Speculative)
    NO ↓
    
Is it story/vision/imagination?
    YES → Canon IV (Narrative)
    NO ↓
    
Unclear? → Start with Canon III and refine
```

## Mixed Ideas: How to Separate

Most ideas contain elements from multiple Canons. Here's how to split them:

### Example: "Meditation enhances tooth healing"

**Canon I Component**: 
- Studies on meditation reducing inflammation
- Measured effects on stress hormones
- Statistical correlation with healing rates

**Canon III Component**:
- Theory about consciousness affecting biology
- Speculation on coherence states
- Framework for mind-body interaction

**Canon IV Component**:
- Stories of healers and their methods
- Vision of integrated medicine
- Patient experience narratives

## Language Clues for Classification

### Canon I Language
- "Studies show..."
- "Measured at..."
- "Statistically significant..."
- "Evidence indicates..."
- "Data demonstrates..."

### Canon II Language
- "Specifications include..."
- "Built with..."
- "Operates at..."
- "Efficiency of..."
- "Patent pending..."

### Canon III Language
- "We propose..."
- "It's possible that..."
- "This model suggests..."
- "Hypothetically..."
- "Speculatively..."

### Canon IV Language
- "Imagine if..."
- "In this story..."
- "What if we could..."
- "The vision is..."
- "Once upon a time..."

## The Evolution Path

Ideas can move between Canons as they develop:

### Upward Flow (Natural)
Canon I → II → III → IV
- Discovery inspires invention
- Invention sparks theory
- Theory fuels imagination

### Downward Flow (Requires Work)
Canon IV → III → II → I
- Story suggests framework
- Framework guides design
- Design enables testing
- Testing yields evidence

---

## Practical Examples

### Idea: "Sound frequencies affect crystal growth"

**Classification Process**:
1. Is it measurable? YES - experiments possible
2. Current evidence? Some studies exist
3. **Result**: Canon I (with proper citations)

### Idea: "The CHIMERA Cube could model consciousness"

**Classification Process**:
1. Can it be built? Focus is on the device specs
2. Are specs provided? If yes → Canon II
3. Is it about what it might do theoretically? → Canon III

### Idea: "Humans will merge with AI symbiotically"

**Classification Process**:
1. Testable now? NO
2. Buildable now? NO  
3. Logical framework? Could be, but seems more...
4. Imaginative vision? YES
5. **Result**: Canon IV

## Your Canonization Checklist

Before publishing any idea:

□ Identified primary Canon
□ Separated mixed elements
□ Added appropriate disclaimer
□ Cited evidence (Canon I only)
□ Included feasibility (Canon II only)
□ Marked speculation (Canon III)
□ Noted fiction (Canon IV)
□ Cross-referenced related Canons
□ Used appropriate language
□ Avoided category errors

## Remember

**The goal isn't to restrict ideas but to present them honestly.**

- Bold claims need bold evidence (Canon I)
- Cool devices need real specs (Canon II)
- Big theories need clear speculation labels (Canon III)
- Great visions need narrative freedom (Canon IV)

Each Canon has its own power. Use them wisely.

*When in doubt, start with Canon III (Speculative) and let evidence guide you toward Canon I or imagination pull you toward Canon IV.*
