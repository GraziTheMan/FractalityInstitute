### 3.1 Automated Quality Metrics

```python
def calculate_data_quality_score(eeg_data):
    """
    Real-time quality assessment
    """
    scores = {
        'signal_to_noise': check_snr(eeg_data),        # >10 dB
        'impedance_stability': check_impedance(eeg_data), # <5 kΩ variation
        'artifact_ratio': check_artifacts(eeg_data),    # <20% rejected
        'frequency_validity': check_spectra(eeg_data),  # No impossible peaks
        'session_completeness': check_duration(eeg_data) # >80% recorded
    }
    
    return weighted_average(scores)
```

### 3.2 Statistical Controls

**Within-Participant**:
- Require minimum 5 sessions for inclusion
