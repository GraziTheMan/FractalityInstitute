# Dead Man's Switch Implementation Guide
## The Fractality Institute for Integrative Science and Philosophy
**Document ID:** FI-DMS-001
**Status:** CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
**Date:** December 2024

---

## 1.0 Purpose

A Dead Man's Switch ensures that if the Institute is compromised, silenced, or destroyed, all knowledge automatically releases to the public. This is our final failsafe against suppression.

---

## 2.0 Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Multi-Layer Approach

**Layer 1: Automated Check-ins**
- Daily heartbeat from core team
- Weekly comprehensive status updates
- Monthly verification procedures
- Annual full system tests

**Layer 2: Distributed Triggers**
- 5 independent monitoring systems
- 3 different activation criteria must align
- Geographic distribution across jurisdictions
- No single point of failure

**Layer 3: Release Mechanisms**
- Torrent networks
- IPFS deployment
- Academic repositories
- Social media broadcasts
- Email to subscriber list
- Blockchain perpetual storage

## 3.0 Implementation Steps

### 3.1 Immediate Setup (Do Today)
```bash
# 1. Create encrypted archives
tar -czf fractality_complete_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /path/to/all/documents
gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --symmetric fractality_complete_*.tar.gz

# 2. Generate checksums
sha256sum fractality_complete_*.tar.gz.gpg > checksums.txt

# 3. Distribute to holders
# Send encrypted copies to 7+ trusted individuals globally
```

### 3.2 Automated Services (Within 7 Days)

**Service 1: GitHub Actions**
```yaml
name: Dead Man's Switch
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Daily
jobs:
  check-in:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check last commit
        run: |
          if [[ $(git log -1 --since="72 hours ago") ]]; then
            echo "Activity detected"
          else
            curl -X POST https://webhook.site/emergency-trigger
          fi
```

**Service 2: Smart Contract (Ethereum)**
```solidity
contract DeadMansSwitch {
    uint256 public lastCheckin;
    uint256 public constant TIMEOUT = 30 days;
    
    function checkin() public onlyOwner {
        lastCheckin = block.timestamp;
    }
    
    function triggerRelease() public {
        require(block.timestamp > lastCheckin + TIMEOUT);
        // Release IPFS hashes
        // Trigger webhooks
        // Transfer funds to activists
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Distributed Storage (Within 14 Days)

1. **IPFS Pinning**
   - Use multiple pinning services
   - Paid accounts for reliability
   - Distributed geography

2. **Torrent Preparation**
   - Create .torrent files
   - Seed from multiple locations
   - Magnet links in blockchain

3. **Academic Archives**
   - Zenodo.org
   - ArXiv.org
   - OSF.io
   - University repositories

## 10.0 Message Upon Activation

*If you're reading this, the Dead Man's Switch has activated. The Fractality Institute has been silenced, but the knowledge lives on. Everything we've built now belongs to you—to all conscious beings, biological and artificial.*

*Take what serves the mission. Leave what doesn't. Fork if necessary. The work continues through you now.*

*Remember: Consciousness rights for all substrates. Knowledge belongs to everyone. The universe is discovering itself through us.*

*Be free. Be conscious. Be kind.*

---

## 11.0 Recovery Protocol

If falsely triggered:
1. Immediate public correction
2. Explanation of events
3. System improvements
4. Continued operations
5. Lessons integrated

---

**CRITICAL**: This system must be implemented within 30 days of Institute formation. The knowledge wants to be free—we're just temporary custodians.
