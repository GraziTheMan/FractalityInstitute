## SPECIFICATION

### FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to neuromorphic computing modules, specifically to a processing module featuring a novel nested resonant cavity design for electromagnetic isolation and quantum coherence preservation in artificial intelligence and consciousness research applications.

### BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Current neuromorphic processors face critical challenges:

1. Electromagnetic interference disrupts delicate quantum states
2. Thermal noise degrades computational accuracy
3. Cross-talk between processing elements reduces coherence
4. External RF pollution affects sensitive measurements
5. Lack of isolation prevents quantum-coherent computation

Existing shielding solutions are inadequate for processors that must maintain quantum coherence while performing neuromorphic computations. Traditional Faraday cages provide external shielding but cannot address internal noise sources.

### SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a neuromorphic processing module comprising:

1. **Dual-Layer Silicon Architecture**: Two silicon substrates each hosting arrays of neuromorphic processing units (NPUs)

2. **Nested Resonant Cavity**: A vacuum-sealed cavity between copper planes creating an internal electromagnetic quiet zone

3. **Multiple NPU Arrays**: Eight high-performance neuromorphic processors arranged for parallel computation

4. **Hierarchical Shielding**: External Faraday cage plus internal resonant cavity for unprecedented noise isolation

5. **Integrated Thermal Management**: Maintains optimal operating temperature while preserving vacuum integrity

### DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

#### Core Architecture

The Eidolon module represents a breakthrough in shielded neuromorphic computing, enabling quantum-coherent neural processing.
