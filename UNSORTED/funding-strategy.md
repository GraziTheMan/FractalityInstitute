═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This document outlines the Fractality Institute's approach to
securing sustainable funding while maintaining our commitment to
open science, accessibility, and independence. We demonstrate that
ethical funding and excellent research are not just compatible—
they're synergistic.

Core Principle: Financial sustainability without mission compromise
Target: $10M annual budget by Year 3, $25M by Year 5

## 1.0 Funding Philosophy

### 1.1 Non-Negotiable Principles

**What We Will NEVER Do**:
- Paywall essential research
- Accept strings-attached funding
- Compromise data privacy for profit
- Create artificial scarcity
- Pursue profit over purpose

**What We ALWAYS Do**:
- Maintain transparent finances
- Diversify funding sources
- Align money with mission
- Share resources equitably
- Build community wealth

### 1.2 The Open Science Paradox

Traditional thinking: "If it's free, how do you fund it?"
Our approach: "Because it's free, people want to fund it."

```
Open Science → Greater Impact → More Support → Better Science
     ↑                                                    ↓
