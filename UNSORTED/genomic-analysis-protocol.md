## 3.0 Pattern Discovery Algorithms

### 3.1 Boundary Sequence Analysis

```python
def find_boundary_signatures(genome, boundary_genes):
    """
    Search for conserved motifs near tissue boundary genes
    """
    signatures = []
    for gene in boundary_genes:
        # Extract 10kb upstream and downstream
        flanking = extract_flanking_sequence(genome, gene, 10000)
        
        # Look for:
        # - Repeated motifs (potential rule encoding)
        # - Palindromes (bidirectional sensing)
        # - Conserved non-coding elements
        
        motifs = find_enriched_motifs(flanking)
        palindromes = find_palindromic_sequences(flanking)
        conserved = find_conserved_elements(flanking)
        
        signatures.append({
            'gene': gene,
            'motifs': motifs,
            'palindromes': palindromes,
            'conserved': conserved
        })
    
    return signatures
```

### 3.2 Rule Module Detection

```python
def identify_rule_modules(genome):
    """
    Find potential IF-THEN-ELSE genetic circuits
    """
    # Pattern: Sensor → Logic → Effector
    
    rule_patterns = []
    
    # Search for gene clusters with:
    # 1. Sensory domain proteins (receptors, channels)
    # 2. Transcription factors (logic gates)
    # 3. Effector proteins (morphogenetic factors)
    
    for chromosome in genome:
        clusters = find_gene_clusters(chromosome, max_distance=50000)
        
        for cluster in clusters:
            if has_sensor_logic_effector_pattern(cluster):
                rule_patterns.append(cluster)
    
    return rule_patterns
```

### 3.3 Cross-Species Conservation Analysis

```python
def find_conserved_rule_elements(species_list):
    """
    Identify rule elements conserved across species
    """
    # Align regulatory regions across species
    alignments = multiple_sequence_alignment(species_list)
    
    # Find ultra-conserved non-coding elements
    ucne = find_ultra_conserved_elements(alignments, min_length=50)
    
    # Analyze for:
    # - Position relative to developmental genes
    # - Presence of regulatory motifs
    # - Correlation with morphological complexity
    
    return analyze_ucne_patterns(ucne)
```

        for grammar in population:
            predictions = apply_grammar_to_genomes(grammar, genomic_data)
            fitness = compare_to_morphology(predictions, morphological_outcomes)
