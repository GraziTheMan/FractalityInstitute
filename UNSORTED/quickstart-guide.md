# 🚀 Quick Start: Join the Riemann Resonance Project in 5 Minutes

Welcome consciousness explorer! This guide gets you collecting data for humanity's most ambitious consciousness experiment in just 5 minutes.

## 🎯 What You're Doing

Testing whether your brainwaves contain frequencies that match the Riemann zeros—potentially the most fundamental mathematical pattern in the universe.

## ⚡ Fastest Path (With Muse Headband)

### 1. Get a Muse (2 minutes)
- **Order**: [Muse S Headband on Amazon](https://amazon.com) (~$250)
- **Alternative**: Borrow one from a friend or local meditation center
- **Budget option**: NeuroSky MindWave (~$100)

### 2. Install Software (1 minute)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fractality-institute/fractality-institute.git
cd fractality-institute/canon-1-empirical/riemann-resonance

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements-muse.txt
```

### 3. Quick Test (2 minutes)
```bash
# Test your connection
python test_muse_connection.py

# If successful, you'll see:
# ✅ Muse connected successfully!
# ✅ Signal quality: Good
# ✅ Ready to record
```

### 4. Your First Recording (5 minutes)
```bash
# Start recording
python record_session.py --duration 300

# Follow the prompts:
# 1. Put on your Muse
# 2. Sit comfortably  
# 3. Close your eyes
# 4. Breathe naturally
# 5. Let the system record
```

### 5. Upload & See Results (1 minute)
```bash
# Upload your data
python upload_data.py

# You'll receive:
# - Your personal Riemann correlation score
# - Comparison to global average
# - Contribution confirmation
```

## 📱 Mobile App Alternative

**Even Easier**: Download our mobile app (coming soon!)
1. Download "Fractality Resonance" from App Store/Google Play
2. Connect your EEG device
3. Tap "Start Session"
4. View results instantly

## 🧪 No EEG Device? No Problem!

### Option 1: Subjective Protocol
```bash
# Run the subjective experience tracker
python subjective_protocol.py

# Answer questions about:
# - Mental clarity (1-10)
# - Synchronicity experiences
# - Pattern recognition moments
# - Dream recall
```

### Option 2: Find a Local Node
Check our [map of local research nodes](https://riemann.fractality.institute/map) where you can use shared equipment.

### Option 3: University Labs
Many universities have EEG labs. We provide a letter explaining the research for lab access requests.

## 📊 What Happens to Your Data?

1. **Immediately**: You see your personal frequency analysis
2. **Daily**: Your data contributes to global pattern detection
3. **Weekly**: You receive updates on collective findings
4. **Monthly**: Published reports on emerging patterns

## 🏆 Gamification & Rewards

- **First Upload**: "Pioneer" badge
- **7-Day Streak**: "Consistent Explorer" achievement  
- **Found Pattern**: "Pattern Hunter" recognition
- **Top Contributor**: Monthly feature in newsletter

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Data

1. **Same Time Daily**: Your brain has rhythms—respect them
2. **Pre-Session Ritual**: 2 minutes of deep breathing
3. **Post-Session Notes**: Record any unusual experiences
4. **Stay Hydrated**: Better conductivity = better signal

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to Muse"
```bash
# Reset Bluetooth
python reset_bluetooth.py

# Use direct mode
python record_session.py --mode direct
```

### "Poor signal quality"
- Wet the sensors slightly
- Adjust headband position
- Check battery level
- Move away from WiFi routers

### "Analysis failing"
```bash
# Run diagnostic
python diagnose_data.py --file your_session.csv

# Common fixes shown automatically
```
