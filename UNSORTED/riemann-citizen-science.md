This document launches a revolutionary citizen science project to test
whether human consciousness resonates with the Riemann zeros. Every
participant contributes to potentially groundbreaking discoveries.

Priority: MAXIMUM - This is our moonshot
Timeline: Launch within 60 days

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 1.0 Executive Summary

We're building the largest consciousness research dataset in history. Using consumer EEG devices and smartphones, thousands of participants worldwide will test whether their brainwaves correlate with the fundamental frequencies of mathematics.

**The Question**: Do the Riemann zeros—the most mysterious numbers in mathematics—appear in the frequency patterns of human consciousness?

**The Method**: Distributed EEG collection, standardized protocols, open data

**The Stakes**: Understanding the deepest connection between mind and mathematics

## 4.0 The Three Core Experiments

### Experiment A: Baseline Mapping
**Question**: Do Riemann frequencies appear naturally in consciousness?
**Protocol**: Record resting EEG, analyze for Riemann correlations
**Duration**: 30 days baseline collection

### Experiment B: Entrainment Testing  
**Question**: Can we enhance Riemann resonance through audio?
**Protocol**: Listen to scaled Riemann frequencies, measure entrainment
**Duration**: 30 days with audio stimulus

### Experiment C: Collective Coherence
**Question**: Do synchronized groups show stronger patterns?
**Protocol**: Global meditation at synchronized times
**Duration**: Weekly sessions for 3 months
