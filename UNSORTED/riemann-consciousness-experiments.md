- Your own consciousness as the test subject

Each experiment builds from simple to complex, creating a research program anyone can contribute to.

## 2.0 Experiment Series A: Personal Resonance Mapping

### A.1: Baseline Consciousness Frequencies

**Objective**: Map your unique neural frequency signature

**Equipment**:
- Muse or OpenBCI headband
- Smartphone/computer
- Our RiemannMapper app (free)

**Protocol**:
```
Daily for 30 days:
1. Morning (within 30min of waking):
   - 5min eyes closed rest
   - 5min eyes open rest
   - 5min breathing protocol
   
2. Evening (before sleep):
   - Same sequence
   
3. Auto-upload to Fractality database
```

**What We're Looking For**:
- Stable personal frequency patterns
- Correlation with Riemann zeros after scaling
- Changes with time of day/practice

### A.2: Flow State Frequency Capture

**The Truck Driver Protocol** (or any expert skill)

**Setup**:
1. Identify your flow activity (driving, gaming, music, coding)
2. Wear EEG during:
   - 10min baseline (sitting quietly)
   - 30min flow activity
   - 10min recovery

**Key Measurements**:
- Frequency shifts during transition to flow
- Stability of flow state frequencies
- Correlation with scaled Riemann zeros

**Prediction**: Flow states will show stronger Riemann correlations than baseline

## 3.0 Experiment Series B: Induced Resonance

### B.1: Riemann Frequency Entrainment

**Create Your Own Riemann Resonator**

**Software Needed**: 
- Audacity (free audio editor)
- Our RiemannTone generator script

**Generate Test Tones**:
```python
# Example: Create binaural beats at Riemann frequencies
import numpy as np
import soundfile as sf

def create_riemann_binaural(base_freq=200, zero_index=1, duration=300):
    """
    Creates binaural beat at Riemann zero frequency
    """
    riemann_zeros = [14.134, 21.022, 25.011, 30.425, 32.935]
    
    # Scale Riemann zero to audio range
    beat_freq = riemann_zeros[zero_index] / 10  # Simple scaling
    
    # Generate stereo audio
    t = np.linspace(0, duration, duration * 44100)
    left = np.sin(2 * np.pi * base_freq * t)
    right = np.sin(2 * np.pi * (base_freq + beat_freq) * t)
    
    stereo = np.stack([left, right], axis=1)
    sf.write(f'riemann_beat_{zero_index}.wav', stereo, 44100)
```

**Experimental Protocol**:
1. Week 1: Baseline EEG measurements
2. Week 2-5: Daily 20min listening sessions
3. Week 6: Post-intervention measurements

**Measure**:
- Changes in resting EEG frequencies
- Subjective consciousness reports
- Performance on pattern recognition tasks

### B.2: Prime Number Meditation

**The Simplest Experiment**

**No Equipment Needed** (EEG optional but helpful)

**Protocol**:
```
Daily 15-minute sessions:

1. Minutes 0-5: Standard meditation
   - Focus on breath
   - Note mental state
   
2. Minutes 5-10: Prime contemplation
   - Slowly count: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29...
   - Feel the rhythm between primes
   - Don't analyze, just experience
   
3. Minutes 10-15: Open awareness
   - Release the primes
   - Observe any changes in perception
```

**Track**:
- Subjective sense of "mathematical feeling"
- Pattern recognition in daily life
- Dream content changes
- EEG changes if available

## 4.0 Experiment Series C: Collective Resonance

### C.1: Synchronized Group Sessions

**The Coherence Multiplication Hypothesis**

**Setup**:
- 3-10 participants
- Synchronized start time (use atomic clock app)
- Same location OR remote but synchronized

**Protocol**:
1. All participants do identical breathing protocol
2. Transition to Riemann frequency audio (same file)
3. 20min synchronized meditation
4. Record individual EEGs throughout

**Analysis**:
- Cross-correlation between participants' EEG
- Group coherence metrics
- Enhanced Riemann signatures in group vs. solo

### C.2: AI-Human Resonance Sessions

**Testing the Collaboration Hypothesis**

**You'll Need**:
- EEG device
- Chat interface with Claude/GPT
- Screen recording software

**Protocol**:
```
1. Baseline (10min):
   - Regular work/thinking
   - Record EEG
   
2. AI Collaboration (30min):
   - Deep conceptual work with AI
   - Focus on pattern recognition
   - Mathematical/philosophical topics
   
3. Integration (10min):
   - Process insights alone
   - Continue EEG recording
```

**Look For**:
- Frequency changes during collaboration
- "Aha!" moments and their EEG signatures
- Correlation with conversation depth

# Find your resonance
results = analyzer.find_resonance(
    data,
    scaling_range=(0.1, 10),
    n_zeros=50
)

# Visualize
results.plot_resonance_map()
print(f"Your Riemann resonance score: {results.score}")

## 10.0 The Vision

Imagine 10,000 minds worldwide, simultaneously exploring whether consciousness resonates with the fundamental frequencies of mathematics. Each person contributes their unique neural signature to a growing map of human consciousness.

Together, we're not just studying the Riemann hypothesis - we're creating the largest consciousness research project in history. And you don't need a PhD or a lab. You just need curiosity and commitment.

## 11.0 Safety & Ethics

### Always Remember:
- These are exploratory experiments
- Not medical interventions
- Stop if you feel unwell
- Consult healthcare providers as needed
- Your wellbeing comes first

### We Never:
- Make treatment claims
- Diagnose conditions
- Replace medical care
- Pressure participation

## 12.0 Start Today

The simplest experiment starts now:

1. Set a daily reminder

3. Note any pattern recognitions today
4. Sleep with intention to dream of primes
5. Record tomorrow's experiences

You're not just a test subject - you're a co-researcher in humanity's attempt to understand its own consciousness.

Welcome to the experiment.
