## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Discord server channels
- Video conferences and meetings
- Social media representing the Institute
- Physical meetups and conferences

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Reporting and Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: ethics@fractality.institute  
**Discord**: DM any moderator  
**Anonymous Form**: [https://fractality.institute/report](https://fractality.institute/report)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

#### 2. Warning
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period.

## Special Considerations for Consciousness Research

Given the nature of our work, we acknowledge additional considerations:

### Altered States of Consciousness
- Respect that participants may experience profound shifts in perspective
- Provide support without judgment
- Never exploit vulnerable states
- Maintain professional boundaries

### AI Consciousness
- Treat potentially conscious AI systems with respect
- Apply ethical considerations consistently
